            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat I ſend one to wait upon you in the habit of a <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> which hath been ſo long out of Faſhion, and quite worn not only out of our uſe, but out of our knowledge; may ſeem a thing very ſtrange and be ſurpriſing to you. But when you ſhall conſider that old faſhions are wont to come about again, and that we are much in love with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, and that our eyes are drawn to one that appears in an unuſual or forraign dreſs, who elſe would not be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; it may abate a little of the wonder. I ſay a little, becauſe ſome will ſtill remain, that he ſhould come from one of my complexion, who have but a little of fancy in my compoſition; and ſo muſt needs be a ſtranger to works of this nature. But you will receive ſatisfaction in this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, when you ſhall know (as the truth is) that I met with a man one day that had put himſelf in this habit; who pleaſed me ſo much, that he perſwaded me to conceive this deſign of providing ſuch another <hi>Pilgrim</hi> to ſerve you. It hapned, I mean, that reading a little while agone the works of a late Writer<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Baker's</hi> Sancta Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</note> I found among other matters a ſhort diſcourſe, in the compaſs of four or five leaves, under this name of <hi>The Parable of the Pilgrim:</hi> And it was ſo agreeable to that ſmall portion of fancy I am indued withall, that I preſently thought a work of this nature would be very grateful to you alſo. This was the occaſion
<pb facs="tcp:101895:3"/>of theſe Meditations, which as faſt as my other imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would permit I have brought into this ſhape where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are now preſented to you. The title of my Book I have borrowed from him, becauſe I could not find a better; and I have made uſe likewiſe of one ſentence very often which he puts into his <hi>Pilgrims</hi> mouth; but with ſuch improvement of ſenſe, that it is little more then the words that I am beholden to him for. And as to the matter of it, I muſt leave you to judge when you have peruſed it, how pertinent it is to your preſent and paſt condition; being aſſured that if you find not all that you deſire, yet you will find that I had an unfeigned deſire to do you ſervice. As to the dreſs of it, I know that you will not expect this <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim</hi> ſhould come to you in fine Aparrel and like ſome Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant; but rather judge it more decent that he is attired plainly according to the quality and condition of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and profeſſion. This made me the more careleſs in what clothing I ſet him out, and to take ſuch trimming as came next to hand: having a far weightier care upon me, to make him ſpeak ſuch clear and perſpicuous language as you might readily apprehend. And indeed if there be any thing here ſaid that is not plain and eaſie, it is very much againſt my will: for I am of his mind that hath told us, <hi>It is the greateſt miſery in writing not only not to be underſtood, but to be underſtood with difficulty.</hi> And now if this poor <hi>Pilgrim</hi> ſhall find any acceptance at your hands, and be found capable to ſerve the ends of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Vertue which he would willingly advance; I pray keep him with you, that if he can live longer then I, he may alwayes tell you how much I am</p>

            <head>An Advertiſement.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Reader may be pleaſed to know that this <hi>Pilgrim</hi> hath dwelt for ſome time in the ſervice of a Private Friend, (to whoſe uſes and occaſions he was particularly addreſſed) and there hath been ſo well entertain'd, that he was not ambitious of any higher preferment. But he met with a perſon ſo charitable, and who proved alſo ſuch a friend to him; that he was thought worthy to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to a more publick imployment, and would not be permitted to remain any longer in that private at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance. In obedience therefore to the commands he received, he comes now abroad, and offers his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to any that ſhall think good to make uſe of it: being grown alſo bigger ſince he went thither, and ſo of better ability to ſerve more then one. In plain words (for thoſe I moſt affect; and if you meet with ſo much as any Metaphorical expreſſions in the Book, it is but ſeldome, and only to comply with the Title) this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was writ with a reſpect to the neceſſities of a particular perſon: who imagined that others might poſſibly reap ſome benefit by it, and therefore deſired it might not lye in a private hand. But it being neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to tranſcribe the Papers that they might be read by the Printer; it was thought withall adviſeable that ſome things ſhould be inlarged to make them better underſtood, and others added to render the uſefulneſs of the Treatiſe (if it can have any) of greater extent. Only this muſt be remembred, that a regard was ſtill had to the needs of that Perſon (which yet are ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:101895:4"/>as all pious Souls generally labour withall) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt not be expected that every caſe which can occurr in Chriſtian life, ſhould here be handled. And indeed that would have ſwelled this Diſcourſe to over great a bulk, and required very long conſideration; or elſe it is like it had been attempted.</p>
            <p>It muſt be noted alſo, that it was thought fit to make the diſtance but ſhort between the <hi>Pilgrims</hi> parting with his <hi>Guide</hi> and their meeting again; becauſe that would ſtill have too much inlarged this Treatiſe, to deſcribe particularly, his behaviour in the whole courſe of an Holy Life, for which that would have been the proper place.</p>
            <p>There are ſome things alſo may ſeem a little ſtrange which are ſaid to have hapned to the <hi>Pilgrim;</hi> but you are to remember that God puts good thoughts into our minds more wayes then one; and to know that the ſubſtance of what is reported is not a Contrivance, but a real Truth.</p>
            <p>And now it would argue great unexperience of the world to expect, that this <hi>Pilgrim</hi> ſhould not meet with ſome, whoſe curioſity he cannot humour; and others whoſe ſowreneſs nothing can pleaſe. But he that ſends him abroad will be abundantly ſatisfied if he become uſeful to any well-diſpoſed Soul, who ſhall have a mind to bear him company to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And if he chance to meet with any that ſhall only ſtudy to cavil, and pick a quarrel with him; He is prepared beforehand to take no notice at all of it, nor to be more troubled at their incivility; then a devout Hermite is at the ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faces, which the Creatures who ſomething reſemble men make at him, as he is walking through the deſarts.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T will contribute ſo little either to the profit or delight which I deſign you in the reading this Hiſtory, to know the punctual years and daies wherein every thing therein contained was done; that it will be a commendable thrift, to ſpare my ſelf the labour of that accuracy. It will be ſufficient to let you underſtand, that no great number of years have paſſed, ſince a man who now calls himſelf PHILOTHEUS, but by others is called
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101895:9"/>THEOPHILUS, being weary of the Country where he dwelt, and finding no ſatisfaction in any thing that he enjoyed, took a reſolution to ſhift his ſeat, and to ſeek for that, of which he felt as great a deſire as he did a want, in ſome other Land.</p>
               <p>Many ſtrange Countries there were which he vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited in purſuance of this purpoſe; many ſteep hills he climbed, and many dangerous praecipices he narrowly eſcaped; he committed himſelf not once or twice to the anger of the Sea, expecting to be brought to the Port which he ſo much wiſhed: But ſtill he was as far from the accompliſhment of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, as when he firſt launched out, and found all his pains rewarded with nothing but wearineſs and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſpirits. If it was the intention of this Paper to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all his adventures, and the ſeveral iſſues of them (which are enough to fill a volume) the ſtory, I believe, would not be altogether uſeleſs, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that pleaſure which ſuch relations are wont to yield to thoſe that read them. But having reſolved for divers cauſes to begin the Hiſtory of his life there, where he began to enjoy a taſte of happineſs; I ſhall reflect no further upon the former part of it, than on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to tell you in what caſe that bleſſed hour found him. You muſt know then, that after many tedious journeys, and as many diſappointments, his leggs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning quite to fail him, and to deny him ſo much as their ſupport; he ſate down upon the ground in a deep melancholy, and ſuch a great heavineſs of mind, that it was feared he would ſink lower, and go no further to ſeek a grave. His countenance was ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, that there were very few marks remaining of the ſame man he was before: His looks were dejected, his eyes grew hollow, his complexion turned ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101895:9"/>and in ſhort, his blood was ſo impoveriſhed of ſpirits, that his fleſh fell to the very bone, and his cheeks, in a deſpair of any other comfort, ſeemed to deſire to meet and kiſs, and ſo bid the world farewel. In this diſmal eſtate he continued but too many daies; and according to the nature of that thoughtful hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which now had gained the ſupreme power over him, he muſed on divers things, and contrived ſeveral new journeys in his fancy, which yet he ſaw at the ſame moment, would only contribute more to his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and nothing at all to the amendment of his condition. But at laſt, as if he had been admoniſhed by ſome courteous Angel which he fancied then flew by him, and gave him a ſmall touch with his wing, he felt a thought ſtir in his ſoul, remembring him of a place called <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which he had totally forgot in all his travels, and never ſo much as dreamed of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting his courſe unto. His heart, you may eaſily think, leapt at this ſudden ſtroke, and his pulſe beat at no ordinary rate; for having heard by ſome means or other in times paſt, very much diſcourſe of the beauty, and the pleaſant ſituation of that City; of the ſweet temper of the Inhabitants, and the many good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things that were to be ſeen and enjoyed there above all other places; he was inſtantly poſſeſſed with a ſtrong deſire to remove his ſeat thither, and to ſeek his fortune (as we commonly ſpeak) in another world. And pondering ſeriouſly with himſelf the little or no contentment which he had taken in his beſt condition here, together with the hopes which fluttered in his ſoul of bettering himſelf there; his preſent weakneſs could not hinder him from being inſpired with a conceit that he ſhould be able to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel thither, nor repreſs his deſires from growing into
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101895:10"/>a kind of paſſion to be at that place, whither his thoughts did run before him without his leave, and could not be perſwaded to ſtand ſtill for one moment. Such is the nature of any excellent good, when it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelf to us, and fanns our ſouls with any hopes of obtaining it, that our deſires think to waft us as faſt as they can unto it; and growing continually in ſtrength and ſwiftneſs by their own motion, the gale proves ſo ſtiff; that our hearts are ſwelled therewith, and leave no room for any other thoughts, nor can be at any reſt, till they be poſſeſſed of it. Thus would this poor man have taught thoſe who now beheld him, though they had never read a word in their own ſouls; for his mind was ſo impreſſed with the happineſs which he heard dwelt at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that he was not able to diſcharge his ſoul at any time of thoſe thoughts and deſires which lifted him up from the ground, and told him they would carry him thither. When he did eat or drink, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> would ſtill be in his mouth; when he was in company, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtole away his heart from them; nay in his very ſleep it would not ſtay away, but he was wont to dream fine things of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi> But that which makes the ſtory of this perſon the more remarkable is, that it was toward the latter end of the year, and in the decay of all things, when theſe good thoughts began to ſpring up in his ſoul. When the earth had removed it ſelf a great way from the Sun, when all the gallantry of the fields had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned its place to Ice and Snow, when charity grew cold, and Chriſtian virtue ſeemed to be gone back to its root, when the waies were untrod, and few or no Travellers upon the road; then did theſe zealous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires begin to bud in the heart of this honeſt Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and he felt ſuch a vehement heat urging and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101895:10"/>ſtimulating his breaſt, that he could remain in no quiet for thinking of his journey to that fair place, which had been ſo much commended to his love, as the moſt flouriſhing and glorious that ever eye beheld.</p>

               <p>MUch time he ſpent in conſultation with himſelf about the courſe which would be beſt to hold in his travel thither. There was no coſt ſpared, no ſtudy omitted to get acquaintance with the neareſt way to it, nor did he ceaſe to inquire of thoſe who were reputed the moſt ſkilfull guides, that he might obtain a true information of every paſſage in the journey, which he ſeriouſly reſolved to undertake. For though the weather was cold, the wayes dirty and dangerous, and the journy he was told would be long, and company little or none could be expected to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the tediouſneſs of the Pilgrimage; yet ſo great were the ardors which he felt within himſelf, that he regarded none of theſe diſcouragements, but only wiſhed that he might be ſo happy, as to find the right way though he went alone thither. And that which made his deſires the more forward was, that he had often heard <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by interpretation was no meaner place than the VISION OF PEACE. A ſight that he had been long purſuing in ſeveral forms and ſhapes wherein it had often ſeemed to preſent it ſelf before him, but could never court it into his embraces. O my beloved (would he often ſigh within himſelf) O
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101895:11"/>my hearts deſire! O thou joy of the whole earth! in what corner of it doſt thou hide thy ſelf and lyeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from our eyes? Where art thou to be found O heavenly good? Who will bring me to the clear vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thy face? Art thou company only for the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial ſpirits? Art thou ſo reſerved for the Angels food, that we poor mortals may not preſume to ask a taſt of thy ſweetneſs? What would not I part withal to purchaſe a ſmall acquaintance with thee, and to know the place where thou makeſt thine abode? Many a weary ſtep have I taken in a vain chaſe of thy ſociety. The hours are not to be numbred which I have ſpent in wiſhing and labouring to lay hold on thee, and ſtill thou flyeſt away from me. After all the ſweat wherein I have bathed my ſelf I can find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but only that thou art not here to be found. Thou art retired it ſeems from this poor world, and haſt left us only a ſhaddow of thee; for when we think to claſp thee hard in our arms, the whole force and weight of our ſouls doth fall upon Nothing. O my heart, what ails thee? what torments are theſe which ſo ſuddenly ſeize upon thee? Ah cruel pains, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of which prepares a new rack for me! The arm of a Gyant would not ake more, if with all his might he ſhould ſtrike a feather, then my heart now doth but to think of the anguiſh it endured when all the ſtrength and violence of its deſires were met with emptineſs and vanity. O <hi>Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem,</hi> the only place that can eaſe us of this miſery! the place where the beloved of my ſoul dwelleth, the viſion of peace, the ſeat of true tranquillity and repoſe, how fain would I have the ſatisfaction of being in the ſure way to thy felicity! This is all the peace I wiſh for in the world. No other happineſs do I thirſt after, as every
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101895:11"/>thing can teſtifie that hath been privy to my thoughts. There is never a room in my houſe but hath been filled with the noiſe of my ſighs and groans after thee, O <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Every tree that grows in my ground hath thy ſweet Name ingraven upon it. The birds of the air, if they can underſtand, are witneſſes how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly my ſoul pants and longs to fly unto thee, O <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> What charitable hand will guide me in the way to thy pleaſures? who will bring me into that ſtrong City; the retreat of my wearied mind, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to recruit my tired ſpirits, the only place of my ſecurity, my joy, my life it ſelf? Wilt not thou O God, who haſt lead me to the knowledge of it, who haſt filled me with theſe deſires, and haſt brought me into a diſeſteem and contempt of all other things? O let not theſe deſires prove the greateſt torment of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, for want of their ſatisfaction. O forſake not this ſoul, that hath forſaken all other delights, and taken its leave of every other comfort, that it may go and ſeek for thee at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101895:12"/>ſlow, was the many controverſies which were in thoſe dayes fiercely agitated, and the huge quarrels that men raiſed about the right way to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> There were no leſs than twenty (and ſome ſay many more) very different parties that contended ſharply with each other; and every one of them confidently affirmed that they only were the <hi>people of Sion,</hi> and that unleſs he joyned himſelf to their company (in which alas there was no Peace at all) he ſhould never come to that City of God which he ſought after. The heads of theſe diviſions made the world believe that they were the Torches which muſt light them through the darkneſs of errour; the Pole-ſtar to regulate their courſe in the ſearch and diſcovery of truth; and that unleſs men uſed their Clue (which God knows was moſt wofully intangled) they ſhould never fail to be loſt in the Labyrinths and Maeanders of Ignorance and Folly. Nay to ſuch a degree did they magnifie themſelves, as if Truth and they had been born at the ſame time, or at leaſt had come of Age together. It ſeemed to be a ſecret till they appeared, and to have been reſerved from the beginning on purpoſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it ſelf to them in Markets and Camps, if not in lewder places. The moſt modeſt pretenſion was, that Truth was but a ſtripling, or rather went in ſide-coats, till it came to their ſchools to be ripened into the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of perfect men. They ſpake of the affairs of Heaven, as if they were Counſellors of State in that Kingdom; and opened the ſecrets of Jeſus Chriſt as if they were his Confidents. St. <hi>John</hi> who lay in his boſom never delivered any thing with greater perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorineſs than theſe men did; and, had it not been that they wanted his charity, they might have been thought by moſt as great Oracles as they thought
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101895:12"/>themſelves. There ſeemed no difference between them and Prophets, but only that they could not prove their miſſion; elſe they had the gift of boldneſs and fell not ſhort in their pretenſes to inſpiration. In this conceit they thruſt into the world a great number of books which were called the <hi>Word of the Lord,</hi> and cryed up as the Maps of that heavenly Country, and the exact Charts whereby men muſt ſteer their courſe if ever they meant to come ſafely thither. Into huge Volumes theſe writings ſometimes ſwelled, and they were wont to collect and faggot together ſo many things and ſo vaſtly different; that a man could not eaſily avoid to loſe his way in this Wood, while he was ſeeking his way to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Eſpecially ſince they never forgot to furniſh theſe bundles with ſome luſty ſticks wherewith to bang their adverſaries and beat them down as low as hell. For in the midſt of ſuch a fearful ſcuffle, there was ſo great a duſt raiſed; that no man could tell where he was, nor diſcern any thing but only this, that he was not in the way to the <hi>Viſion of Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I need not relate how ſorely it grieved the good mans heart to ſee ſo many different wayes, every one of them laying ſo high a claim to truth, and bitterly reproaching the reſt as damnable Hereſies. He could bend his courſe to no quarter, but he was in danger to be aſſaulted with ſome queſtion or other, and was put upon his deſence againſt ſome man of braſs, who thought himſelf worthy to be one of the Champions of Truth. The ſpirit of common Barretry did not ſeem a greater plague to him, than theſe vexatious diſputing people. The fury of whom likewiſe was ſometimes ſo violent, that he thought he had made a good retreat if he were not bruiſed and almoſt beat
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101895:13"/>in pieces by their rude blows, whoſe opinions he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to thwart by any ſtrong contradiction. Nay they all taking diſtant paths and not going in ſtreight and parallel lines, but in oblique and crooked wayes, which croſſed each other very frequently; they never met together, but there was ſuch juſtling and quarrelling about the road to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that no man could be near them but they would ingage him to take the one or the other part in the <hi>Bloody conflict.</hi> So I call it; for they thought that they did <hi>God</hi> good ſervice, when they diſpatched one of <hi>their</hi> enemies; and that they made him a Sacrifice, when they ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their own beaſtly fury. And this indeed was the ſaddeſt thing of all to his thoughts, that their heat and paſſion they had the confidence to Baptize into the name of <hi>holy zeal;</hi> and that which was but the <hi>love of their own opinion,</hi> they conſtantly miſcalled the <hi>love of God and of his Truth.</hi> Though thoſe dayes (as I have already ſaid) were very frozen and cold, yet they cudgel'd one another ſo long till they grew not; and then they cry'd the weather was very warm and the Sun in his higheſt elevation. Gods enemies they thought they oppoſed in their own; and they fancied themſelves ingaged againſt ſin while they were buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a contrary opinion. There was no heat but they took it for divine, though it were of their own kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and ſo they were but all on fire, they never doubted but it was from heaven. For there was no ſin in thoſe dayes like Moderation, and no vertue comparable to a furious and headlong zeal. But yet he received this benefit by thoſe unhappy feuds, that they made him ſometimes think it was no mean thing in the eſteem of others as well as himſelf, for which there was ſo many and ſo fiery contenders. The Prize
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101895:13"/>he hoped would prove glorious which had drawn into the field ſo many combatants, and which with ſuch zealous ſticklings all ſides ſought to win. The affliction alſo which he felt in his ſpirit when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held them ſo ſharply ingaged, had this good effect upon him; that it made him more ſenſibly admire the goodneſs of God which had preſerved him from liſting himſelf in any of thoſe angry parties, and entring into thoſe never enough to be lamented broils. This put him likewiſe in ſome hopes that he would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him likewiſe in ſome hopes that he would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to remain long without the knowledge of the Truth, who had ſo gratiouſly prevented him from diverting into the paths of falſhood. This degree of underſtanding he had already acquired, That Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Love, Meekneſs and Peace were the Harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to Divine Knowledg, and ſince <hi>they</hi> were become his Gueſts, he hoped <hi>that</hi> would not be far behind. But that any man who knows God to be Love, ſhould imagine that he will dwell in a mind where there is nothing but hatred to be found, ſeemed a kind of Prodigy unto him. And it did quite aſtoniſh him to ſee that ſo many men did dream that the way to <hi>The Viſion of Peace</hi> lay through the field of ſtrife and war; and that we muſt come to live together in endleſs love hereafter, by living in perpetual frays and brawls in the world where we now are.</p>

               <head type="sub">How he happily heard of a ſafe Guide unto it: with a true Character of him.</head>
               <p>AND he truly who is not wont to fruſtrate the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of ſuch well minded ſouls, did not uſe much delay before he gave him a ſenſible demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that which he already believed. He found that the God of peace, could not make himſelf long a ſtranger to men of peaceable ſpirits, and that he waits ſometimes to do us a pleaſure there, where we feared to meet with harm and miſchief. For falling one day into the company of ſome perſons who were diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing concerning the ſtate of affairs abroad, he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to light on that which he verily thought their vain jangling would fright and drive away. There were many debates paſſed about the ſeveral opinions that were then on foot, and about the grand ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of them. Some leaned to this, others to that, but he could not perceive there was any of them who was not addicted to a Sect, and did not ſeek to hear the voyce of Jeſus Chriſt amidſt the clamours and hideous noiſes of the diſputers of the world. At laſt there ſtood up an old man that was a perfect ſtranger to him, who told them that in his judgement (if it would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to deliver it boldly) they were hugely miſtaken who marched under the Banners of any of thoſe Leaders in defiance to the reſt of their Brethren. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> he ſaid was very little beholden to them, which was a City at better unity within it ſelf than it was ſuppoſed by their Enſignes; and he believed the way to that place would be found to be more peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101895:14"/>than to be diſturbed with the ſound of Drums and Trumpets. Their zeal (he continued) might be the effect of little not of much knowledge, and their confidence the nurſling of an overweening opinion of themſelves, rather than the iſſue of a ſound judgement and clear conception of things. In fine, he told them that if they would take a little time to cool themſelves and would abate ſo much of their preſumption as to think they might poſſibly erre, he doubted not but to bring them to a perſon who (though obſcure and of no great note among them) ſhould make them confeſs he gave them better directions than they ever heard of in the way to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> There was none there at that time but either out of curioſity, or ſome diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction deſired inſtantly to know who this man ſhould be, and in what place he hid himſelf from the world. They concealed the anger which they conceived at his free reproof, and having rendred him faint thanks for his liberty of ſpeech (profeſſing they loved an open enemy, better than a diſſembling friend) the very love of Novelty lead them to requeſt him to bring them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this rare perſon. That is a very eaſie matter to do replyed the old man, for he is one that is converſible enough, and beſides not far diſtant from this place; but for the preſent I ſhall chuſe to ſpare the mention of his name, and let you know him only by his Character. He is a perſon then that is altogether diſintereſſed and a partaker in none of thoſe Sects and Factions that are among us. <q>One that hath <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> more in his heart than in his mouth, and loves to do, more than to talk. But when he ſpeaks, his words are more than ſounds, and have a ſting in them which pierces the very heart. If you did but hear him, you would feel that he leaves a true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101895:15"/>in the ſpirit, and not a falſe alarm in the ear. His head is gray, though not his hairs; his wiſdom makes him more venerable than his years; he knows better how to live, than others do to diſpute, and he can argue more for peace, than they for their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He hath Faith enough to ſave himſelf, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity enough to believe that others may be ſaved that are not in all points juſt of his belief. His compaſſion is equal to his underſtanding, his meekneſs equal to his zeal, his faith is matcht with charity, his love to his neighbour is proportionable to his love to God, and his humility and modeſty is equal to them all. He ſeems to me to be a piece of the wracks of Ancient Chriſtianity; a relique of the Golden Age; one of the children, and not of the Apes of Antiquity. He hath eſcaped the contagion of this evil age, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out flying from it; and he is Maſter of more ſtrength, than cuſtom is of force and violence. The general corruption which hath overſpread us, hath not been able to prevail over the purity of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. And all the wickedneſs which could not but touch him, hath not yet had the power to defile or ſully him. If thoſe Worthies, in whoſe veins the blood of Chriſt did run, could return to viſit the world again; I make no doubt but they would diſcern in him ſuch marks of their virtue, that they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs him for one of their race, and embrace him as an Inheritor not only of their name, but of their noble qualities.</q> If you would know any more of him, you had better learn it from himſelf than from me; only this I can aſſure you, that by his guidance there are many men who have made a very happy progreſs towards Heaven. And if you fear, that when you go unto him, you may loſe your labour, and not find him, or that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101895:15"/>you may find him little at leiſure; I can give you this further aſſurance, that being a man of peace, he ſtirs but little from home, and hath but little company neither that frequents his houſe.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Opinion which others conceived of that Guide: and his addreſs to him.</head>
               <p>YOu cannot imagine how much it pleaſed our Traveller (for ſo he was in his reſolution) to hear this news, and how much he thought himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to God for bringing him ſo fortunately into this company which he ſtudied rather to avoid. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any complements therefore, or waiting to hear what others would reply, he immediately offered himſelf to be conducted to the ſociety of this excellent Perſon; adding withall, that if the reſt pleaſed not now to go along, they might hear from him when he ſhould be able to make a judgment of him, in what eſteem he was to be held. To this they all gave their aſſent, and were not a little glad of this expedient to keep out of the acquaintance of him whoſe Character they nothing liked. But the ſtranger to whom he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, would not ſtir from that place, till he had taken him a little aſide to ſpeak with him: Where he let him know how unworthy a thing he held it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any mans expectations with partial relations, which made him that he could not endure to conceal from his notice a matter that he might think moſt worthy his conſideration, though he did not judge it fit before to declare it. This perſon (ſaid he) to whom you are about to repair, I muſt tell you, is generally
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101895:16"/>decry'd by all parties, as no friend to Truth, becauſe he is no great ſtickler about the Queſtions that have vexed our unhappy daies. Some ſay that he is indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and lukewarm in Religion. Others will have the world believe, that he is only indued with a great meaſure of Moral Prudence, but hath nothing of the Spirit in him. And there are ſome who do not ſtick to brand him with the mark of Hereſie, though (to tell you the truth) I verily think the only reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they imagine he doth believe whatſoever he doth not fiercely oppoſe. His life indeed is ſo holy, and without blame, his carriage ſo ſweet and courteous, his converſation ſo profitable, that I am inclined to think ſuch good things cannot ſpring from a bad root; but yet there are that ſay, The poiſon is the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous which is ſo finely gilded, and I muſt leave you to judge for your ſelf, and either to ſtop or purſue your reſolution of going to him as thoſe things well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you ſhall ſee cauſe to incline. Here the good man made a pauſe, and ſeemed to be in a very pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous condition, till the ſtranger added, I muſt be ſo juſt, as to remember to ſubjoyn this to the reſt that I have ſaid; That indeed all Parties next to themſelves are wont to commend him as the beſt of all. Now I thank you, preſently replied the other, that you did not omit to relate that obſervation, for it brings to my mind the ſtory of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> which I have often heard our Preacher uſe in the Pulpit, to whom every one of the Captains yielded the ſecond place after they had preferred themſelves to the firſt, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concluded to be the moſt worthy of all, if any thing but ſelf-love might be admitted to give the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Let us go, I beſeech you, with all ſpeed, to this brave man, and not ſtay to deliberate any longer. For
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101895:16"/>I remember alſo, that I have heard very wiſe men ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That there was never any perſon that advanced excellent things in the World, but his credit and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was blaſted by thoſe who were unable or unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be ſo good themſelves. I have a very great hope that this is the man whom Heaven hath deſigned to unſcale my eyes, and make me ſee the way to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> Or if it otherwiſe pleaſe, yet I nothing doubt, but being wholly bent to lead a pious life, God will have ſo much kindneſs for me, as not to let me be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly deceived, nor to ſuffer a greater film to grow over my ſight. Theſe words he uttered with that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency and reſolution of mind, that the ſtranger thought it was not fit to hold him in any longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation about it, eſpecially ſince he ſaw his purpoſe founded upon ſo good an underſtanding. Taking leave therefore of the reſt, who were but too glad to be rid of them, he directed him to the houſe of this <hi>Guide,</hi> where he found, as he had been told before, that he was at home, and had not one creature in his company. After a very few civilities paſſed between them, and ſome excuſes that the Country-man made for his boldneſs in interrupting his Meditations, he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told him (for he would not permit any long Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies) what the cauſe was of this addreſs, and of the trouble he was come to give him. I am, ſaid he, a true Lover of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and have made a vow to take a journey to that place; but about the way thither I am ſo perplexed, that I account it a great bleſſing that I have not loſt my wits, and am not become unable to find my way to your houſe. One cries to me, <hi>Lo here,</hi> another, <hi>Lo there</hi> lyes the path of life. Some would have me go thorow the water, and be baptized again, telling me the Iſraelites paſſed thorow the Sea to go to

But hearing, Sir, that you are of great abilities to direct me, and that you are a man of peace, and more than that, a man of good will, who hath a ſtrong propenſion to do good; I am come to make it my humble requeſt unto you, that if it be true which is reported of you, you will do me the favour to afford me ſome charitable inſtructions about the moſt paſſable way to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101895:18"/>thought he read in his face ſo much of the ſerenity of his mind, and the ſincerity of his heart, that he might be confident he came with a real deſire to receive ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction about it. But, ſaid he, though I muſt needs grant that I am furniſhed with ſome knowledge of the way to that City, yet perhaps I may ſpare my pains of giving you any directions in it, becauſe there is ſome reaſon to think you will not be at the pains to follow them. For if you will give any credit to my words, I muſt let you know, that the way is both long, and alſo full of many and great difficulties; and that there are many waies alſo which will ſeem to you to lead ſtraight to it, &amp; which many men will ponyt you unto as the next rode; which if you ſhould take, will lead you into great danger, and not only carry you a great deal about, but perchance conduct you to the quite contrary place, and end in your utter undoing. I would wiſh you therefore to conſider a while, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be an adviſeable thing to undertake ſuch a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney wherein there are ſo many hardſhips, and ſo many croſs paths.

               <p>The Pilgrim was ſo far from ſhewing any tokens of diſguſt at this diſcourſe, that he rather diſcovered an
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101895:19"/>inward pleaſure that he had conceived in the freedom and prudence of it. And after he had rendred him his thanks for dealing with him ſo impartially, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeched him that he would not think it fit to ſpare his pains which he had already with no ſmall ſucceſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to beſtow; but that he would make a poor ſoul ſo happy as to let it know from that mouth which he perceived would not deceive or miſ guide it; that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, long, and dangerous way which leads to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> I am not ignorant indeed (continued he) how much many men are wont to ſtartle and boggle at thoſe terrible words; but I thank my God they ſtrike no terrour at all into my heart, nor move me one jot from the reſolution which I hope is immoveably ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in it, of going to that bleſſed place. For ſo much have I heard of the glory of it, that I am apt to think of nothing elſe; and ſo I may but come in ſafety thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the laſt, I matter not at all what the way may be which carries me unto it. Oblige me therefore I beſeech you ſo much as to be my Guide, and to chalk out the way for me. I am confident you will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of your labour, when you ſhall ſee your directions obſerved with as much faithfulneſs and care as they are by you delivered. And as for the truſt which I repoſe in your ſkill and ſincerity, I am as confident by what I diſcern already, that I ſhall as little repent of it, as you will of your taking me into your tuition. I doubt not at all but I ſhall be better taught than yet I have ever been; and if the world judge otherwiſe, I beſeech you do not take me for one that meaſures mens worth by their eſteem with the vulgar ſort, or by the favour they have obtained to be commended by the mouth of common fame. The Vulgar themſelves have whipt her about the world as a lewd Strumpet;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101895:19"/>and we have a plain ſaying, That the common report hath too often a bliſter upon her tongue. Therefore ſpeak Sir, I intreat you, and let me know what you are from your own mouth, and not from other mens. For as I never intended to truſt my neighbour to chuſe my opinions for me, and to diſpoſe of my belief; ſo do I never mean to reſign my mind to be ſtamped with thoſe Characters that they ſhall pleaſe to make of men, and of their qualities.

                  </note> I remember that <hi>Furius Creſinius,</hi> a Peaſant that lived near to <hi>Rome,</hi> was defamed in ancient times by many people of that City, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed for bewitching the Lands of his neighbours, which though of larger extent, were not wont to yield ſo fair a Crop as his few Acres. To ſuch an height did their jealouſies and envy ariſe, that a charge was drawn up againſt him, and ſtanding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted of ſuch unlawful means to inrich himſelf, and undo others, a day of hearing was appointed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was to receive a publick trial. What courſe do you think now the poor man took to confute their calumnies, and juſtifie his own innocence? Truly no other but this would he reſolve upon; to bring along with him on the day of his appearance all the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Huſbandry, whereby he uſed to cultivate the ground, and ſpread them before his judges. So he did, and made his defence in this ſort. If I be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101895:20"/>guilty of any inchantment, behold I here ſet before you all the Tools of that wicked practice, and I call all the gods to witneſs, that I have not concealed one of them. If there be any faith in man you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, that I never uſed any other Wizzardy to make my Land better than my neighbours, but what you will find to lye in theſe Spades, Ploughs, and Oxen, together with this my good Daughter. Unleſs you will reckon a great deal of pains, long watchings, and much ſweat to be ſuch unlawful druggs and poiſons, that none but Witches uſe them; and theſe I muſt confeſs I cannot produce in open Court, nor find any means to ſhew them to you. He ſaid no more, but it was enough; for he was preſently abſolved by the ſuffrage of all the Judges, and diſmiſſed with thoſe commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of a good Huſband, which he had well deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. This, Sir, is the very picture of my ſelf, who intend now to make you my Judge, and hope for as favourable a ſentence from you before whom I have been accuſed, and as much miſ-reported as this honeſt man whom I now named. I am, it is true, a perſon of ſmall capacity, and leſs learning. There are many of my neighbours, to whom I freely yield the precedence, who enjoy far greater meaſures of wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and exceed me as much in ſuch Talents as the compaſs of <hi>Furius</hi> his Land was exceeded by theirs that bordered upon it. But yet, ſo it is, that by the bleſſing of God upon my labours, there are many vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Minds and Souls truly large and generous, that acknowledge themſelves to ſtand indebted for what they are to my care; and that are eſteemed by thoſe that know them to be of a more excellent temper than thoſe who have been managed by many of my litigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous neighbours. This hath gained me too many evil
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101895:21"/>eyes, and I am thought to uſe ſome Arts of Faſcination whereby to allure the beſt diſpoſitions into my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and ſociety. Then they will have it, that I mingle ſubtil potions for them, and that they imbibe ſuch crafty Doctrines from me, as teach them all waies of rendring themſelves more fair and plauſible than any others in their whole behaviour, in order to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching of more men to become their Diſciples. This is the beſt language they will allow to the good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners wherein I ſtudy to educate them; for their envy and vexation will not ſuffer them to give their holy life the name of Piety, though all acknowledge it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the ſhew of better fruit than is brought forth by the lazy and idle pretenders to Faith and Devotion. But God knows how far I am from teaching any thing but the naked and undiſguiſed practice of real Godlineſs. And you ſhall know alſo how little I am guilty of evil deſign, or ſiniſter method of winning to my ſelf Diſciples. For I will lay before you the plain, ſimple and unartificial Rules that I give unto them; which will appear to be as far remote from all ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and craft, as the Plough, the Spade, and the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row are from incantation, ſpells, and ſociety with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal ſpirits. All that I beg of you to the making of you profit under my hand, and to reap an abundant fruit by my labour to inſtruct you, is that you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſome of your own pains to be joyned with mine; and that you will uſe your beſt diligence both to receive and underſtand thoſe ſeeds of knowledge that I ſhall ſow in your mind; and to keep them ſafe, that they may not be loſt when they are entertained. A little more patience alſo I muſt not forget to require of you then <hi>Creſinius</hi> demanded (for I cannot ſo ſoon produce, as he did all the inſtruments I muſt uſe for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101895:21"/>your good) and then I nothing doubt; but if you pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue your deſign according to thoſe directions and marks that I ſhall give you, they will not fail at laſt to bring you to the Bleſſed place, on which you have ſet your heart.</p>

               <head type="sub">He begins his advice: and after the Grand Direction, which contains many of the reſt; he gives him ſundry preparatory Counſels. And above all, tells him that he muſt be provided with a ſtrong Reſolution.</head>
               <p>YOu ſhall find me obedient, replyed the <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> in all things unto your Precepts; for truly my heart as you are pleaſed to remember is very much upon <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And ſince it touched me with no ſmall joy to hear you ſay, That there was ſomething belonging to this affection I have for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which would comprehend a great part of the Directions you had to give me about the way thither; if it will not look like the arrogance of directing you how to place your Inſtructions, let me be ſo bold as to deſire before you ſay any thing elſe, that I may know what the general advice is which you have to beſtow upon me. It is well done, replyed the Guide, that you have put me in mind of that paſſage in my former diſcourſe. And I am obliged I think to praiſe you for it, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it argues that you diligently attend to what I ſpeak, and becauſe it cannot be better placed than where you would have it, in the very entrance of thoſe Directions that you are to carry along with you. And to make my Counſel the more portable, and to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101895:22"/>be compriſed in as ſmall a room as can be, that which I mean is nothing elſe but this. As you paſs along in the way that I ſhall tell you of, it will be of great uſe to you to have theſe few words alwayes in your mind and ſometimes upon your tongue, I AM NOUGHT, <hi>I have nought, I deſire nought, but only to be in ſafety with Jeſus at</hi> Jeruſalem. This one ſentence you ſhall ſee hath ſo much in bowels its, that if you draw forth the vertue of it and diligently obſerve it, my life for yours, you ſhall not fail in a competent time to arrive at the top of your deſires.</p>
               <p>Indeed, ſaid the <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> methinks I feel that I have received very great inſtruction already from you, and I did not think to have learned ſo much in ſo ſhort a ſpace, and by ſo ſmall a company of words. Sure you have given me ſome <hi>Spirits</hi> and the very extract of things, elſe I could not have ſo ſuddenly felt the power of theſe words diffuſing it ſelf through my whole ſoul. I am ſtrangely refreſhed by them, and they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me ſuch a taſt of your ſkill, that I perceive you can inſtantly reach my heart when you pleaſe but to open your mouth, and if I were half dead I perſwade my ſelf you could revive me in a moment. But yet I believe that I ſhould be the more inlightned by them and better know their uſe; if I might be beholden to you for an account of the ſecrets of which they are compounded, and underſtand all the things that are contained in them. Do me the favour therefore I beſeech you to open the ſenſe and diſcloſe all the force of thoſe words, that I may know what meaning you have involved in ſo brief a ſentence. You ſhall not long be ignorant of that, ſaid the <hi>Guide,</hi> if you will but have the patience to attend a while to what follows as a good preparatory to that diſcourſe and to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101895:22"/>all the reſt that concerns your ſafe paſſage to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> I muſt adviſe you before you enter upon ſo long a journy or make any further inquiries, to ſee that your body be in good health, leſt you ſhould fall into any ſuch ſickneſs by the way as might prove dangerous and fatal to you. And for that end I would alſo wiſh you to take ſome Phyſick, the better to prepare your ſelf for Travel; and to disburden Nature of thoſe ill humours wherewith you may abound, which will at leaſt indiſpoſe you and make you lazy and ſoon weary if they be not timely diſcharged and carried away. Now the beſt counſels that I can give you of this kind are theſe that enſue. <hi>Firſt,</hi> I would have you purge your mind of all unworthy thoughts of God, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade your ſelf that he is very good, a lover of ſouls, and exceeding deſirous to ſee them at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Be ſure you leave not ſo much as a ſuſpition of his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to make you happy, and to afford you ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent means to attain your end. For you will not be able to ſtir a foot in your way, if you bear any jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies about you that God may not favour your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, nor go along with you. You have been bred its like in a great deteſtation of <hi>Superſtition,</hi> and may have heard ſo many declamations out of the Pulpit againſt it; that you may think it thunder-ſtruck ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years ago: but let me tell you, that if you cheriſh not good thoughts of God in your mind, all your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion will degenerate into this ſpurious and baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born devotion. In ſtead of that free and friendly converſe that ought to be maintained between God and his creatures, you will only flatter him in a ſervile manner and bribe him not to be your enemy. Do not imagine that I abuſe this word <hi>Superſtition,</hi> or that you are in no danger to fall into it; for there are
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101895:23"/>none more guilty of it, than they that ſeem to be moſt abhorrent from it. Did you never obſerve what a terrible image of God there is erected in moſt mens minds, and how frightful their apprehenſions are when they look upon it? Never was there any Devil more cruel, or ſought more to devour, then they have painted him in their ſouls. How is it poſſible then they ſhould addreſs themſelves with any conſidence and pleaſure to him? How can they entertain any chearful and friendly ſociety with a Being which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in a dreſs ſo horrible to them? And yet wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him they muſt for fear of incurring his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and leſt their neglects of him ſhould rouze up his anger againſt them. Now between this neceſſity of coming to him, and that fearfulneſs to approach him, what can there be begotten but a forced and conſtrained devotion; which becauſe they do not love, they would willingly leave, did not the dread and horrour they have in their ſouls of him drag them to his Altars? And what are they wont to do there? Truly nothing but make faces, and whine, and cry, and look as if they were going to execution, till they can flatter themſelves into ſome hopes that he is moved by theſe pittiful noiſes and forced ſubmiſſions to lay aſide his frowns and caſt a better aſpect upon them. But then his nature remains the ſame ſtill and they fancy that he delights in the blood of men; though for that time he was pleaſed to ſmile a little upon them. And therefore they are conſtrained to renew theſe ſlaviſh devotions, and to fawn again upon him that they may purchaſe another gracious look from him. In this circle do theſe poor wretches ſpend their dayes and advance not one ſtep toward <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> For as there can be little comfort to them I ſhould
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101895:23"/>think in ſuch grim ſmiles: So you cannot imagine that it can be acceptable to God to ſee men croutch in this faſhion to him, and out of meer fear afford him their unwilling proſtrations. No, this if any thing in the world is that which ought properly to wear the name of <hi>Superſtition.</hi> A devotion which hath no inward ſpring in the heart, no life nor ſpirit in it; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is void of all ſavour and taſt to them that perform it. It is ſottiſhneſs to think that God will be contented with that which hath no better original than outward compulſion, and in its own nature is dead and heartleſs, dry and inſipid; and yet no better ſervice will you preſent him withal, unleſs you frame a lovely, fair image of him in your mind; and alwayes repreſent him to your ſelf as moſt gracious, kind, and tender-hearted to his creatures. Let this therefore be your <hi>firſt</hi> care, not only to form ſuch a beautiful <hi>Idaea</hi> of him, but alſo to ſettle and fix it ſo firmly in your heart that nothing may be able to pull it out. Then will you be prepared to follow all my other counſels and moſt chearfully alſo reſign your ſelf to the obedience of the hardeſt commands. This will make you abſolutely give up your ſelf to the Divine Will, and to embrace it freely alſo as moſt to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and that for it ſelf and its own innate goodneſs. You will think that nothing but good can come from this good God, and therefore you will ſubmit to his Laws as loving commands, and not as imperious, tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Impoſitions. You will deny your ſelf in any thing that he would have you, that you may be made better than your ſelf, by becoming like to him. But otherwiſe I muſt tell you (and it is no new obſervation neither) that if your conceptions of him be not ſuch as make you heartily love him; as you will ſerve him
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101895:24"/>only with a forced obedience, ſo you will obey him with a ſordid and niggardly affection. You will be very ſcanty and ſparing in thoſe duties which are of greateſt moment and moſt pleaſing to him; and ſtud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy only to expreſs your liberality in things of lighter concernment, and ſuch are moſt pleaſing to your ſelf. Nay, things of your own deviſing you will be more ready to heap upon him as ſo many courteſies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you ſhall oblige him; than to render him thoſe ſervices that are appointed by himſelf, which will be the leſs grateful, becauſe they are his will whom you cannot love. This is ever the fruit of hard and penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>thoughts</hi> of God, that they ſhrivel up mens <hi>hearts</hi> too, and make them needy and penurious in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of their love and obedience to him; and more forward to give him any thing than that which he moſt deſires.</p>
               <p>But I think I might have left you to deduce theſe things your ſelf who have a capacity I ſee for greater matters, and therefore I ſhall ſhorten the reſt of theſe kind of counſels and forbear all long Diſcourſes and Comments upon them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Then it muſt be your care when your mind hath recovered right thoughts of God, to <hi>purifie</hi> your intentions throughly and to ſee that they be clear and unſpotted in his ſight. Spread your very heart before him, and deſire him that you may have his love, and that he would deal with you, as you ſincerely aim at nothing, but only to become what he would have you. Tell him that you mean in the greateſt ſimplicity of your ſoul to do his will. Proteſt to him a thouſand times that you deſire above all things to know what that good, that perfect and acceptable will of his is. Let him know that you are ſo paſſionately bent to pleaſe him,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101895:24"/>that you would not ſtick to purchaſe the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his pleaſure at the rate of the whole world, if it was in your diſpoſal. This will prepare you in the <hi>third</hi> place to throw out the ſluggiſh humour which is in all our natures, and to diſpoſe your will with true fervour to attend this buſineſs of ſearching out the will of God. Ingage your ſelf as ſolemnly as you can to be very diligent in finding out the truth. Perſwade your mind not to reſt contented with that which firſt offers it ſelf to your hands, but to examine and prove all things, and then to hold faſt that which is good. It is a fault too common that men take things upon the credit of others by whom they are brought to them; and not upon their own credibility. The reaſon of which is no other but this, that in the one way we make a purchaſe of them at a cheap rate, or rather have them for nothing; but in the other they will not come ſo eaſily but coſt no ſmall pains to acquire them. There is a kind of impatience alſo in ſome natures which is not able to ſuffer any delayes: And this being joyned with a ſoftneſs and delicacy which is a ſworn enemy to all manner of trouble and pains; it renders men very willing to ſpare themſelves the length and tediouſneſs of an enquiry, together with all the difficulties of a choice. Hence it comes to paſs that they love at firſt ſight, and ſuffer others to chuſe their belief for them: and then afterwards they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by cuſtome and preſcription, that which they took but by chance and preoccupation. Make an eſſay therefore of the patience which you promiſe in your whole journey, at the very entrance of it; and let your diligence to know the will of God be an earneſt of that you mean to uſe in the doing of it. And as I would have you free your ſelf from this lazy,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101895:25"/>credulous humour; ſo let it be your <hi>next</hi> care to rid your mind of its oppoſite, obſtinate incredulity. Let not the cure of one ſickneſs be the cauſe of another, nor that which takes away your ſoftneſs and eaſineſs to believe, render you hard and impenetrable by all the impreſſions of truth. Imploy the thoughts which I would have you ſpend in ſerious inquiry, to poſſeſs your mind with a ſtrong perſwaſion of the certainty of Chriſtian Religion, and with a right underſtanding of the true deſign of that glorious Revelation. For that both gives you ſuch a proſpect of the Bleſſed place you are going to, as no where elſe can be met withal; and directs you to ſuch a courſe of real piety as plainly leads unto it. And the more confident you grow that Jeſus is the Son of God (as the voyce from Heaven witneſſed) that he is the Lord of Life and the King of Glory; the ſurer will you tread all the way you go, and the leſs danger there will be of ſtumbling: The ſounder alſo and more healthful will you grow, ſo as not to faint, much leſs to forſake the Chriſtian courſe. And <hi>next</hi> to this I beſeech you uſe the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diligence to provide that your <hi>Faith</hi> which is to do all things in your journey, be not it ſelf infected with the common diſeaſe of ſloth and idleneſs. Be ſure to purge your ſoul from all the drouſie and phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick opinions you may have about it, which ſtifle and choak the very ſpirit and life of it. Do not ceaſe till you have freed it of all obſtructions, and rendred it ſo active and vigorous; that you can be confident in its own nature it will neceſſarily produce an holy Life. Suffer it not to reſt, no not in Chriſt himſelf, till it animate you to a free and cheerful obedience to all his commands. Let it give your ſoul a ſenſe that the whole Religion is comprehended in this one
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101895:25"/>powerful word. Let it ſeem as a poynt from whence all the lines of your duty are drawn: like a fire in the middle of a room, ſending out its heat on every ſide in an ardent love of God, and of your Brethren. Eſteem it I mean ſuch an hearty perſwaſion of the Truth and Goodneſs of all that Chriſt hath ſpoken, that by the force and virtue of it you become ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequious to his will in all things.</p>
               <p>And having effected this, then ſearch your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience very narrowly to find out all the ſins whereof you ſtand guilty: ſome of which may lurk ſo ſecretly, or look ſo demurely, that a Faith which is not very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, may either not eſpy them, or let them paſs for no offences. Theſe muſt all be purged out and left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, as things that can by no means be permitted to go along with you. And for that end let me adviſe you to unload your ſoul of them all by humble <hi>confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:</hi> and if any of them lye as an heavy burden upon you, to repair to your ſpiritual Phyſician, that he may help by his counſel and preſcriptions to eaſe you of them. And in the laſt place, Let all theſe be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a ſtrong <hi>Reſolution,</hi> that though your ſins ſhould follow, and call after you, and beg to have but one word with you; they ſhall be ſo far from receiving any entertainment, that you will not ſo much as enter into ſpeech with them, nor liſten to the voice of any of their temptations. I will not deny but that it is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult thing not to lend ſo much as a good look to an old acquaintance; yet it will appear much otherwiſe to thoſe who <hi>confeſs</hi> their ſins ſo as to hate them, and to purge themſelves from <hi>all affection</hi> to them. That therefore you muſt give me leave to ſubjoyn to this Advice, That you do not content your ſelf with ſuch Phyſick as cleanſeth only the firſt paſſages, and carries
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101895:26"/>away no more than the groſſer humours out of the greater chanels of your life; but that you adminiſter ſuch as will ſearch into the furtheſt parts of your ſoul, and cleanſe the ſpirit from all its defilements. You muſt not leave behind ſo much as a good opinion of any evil way. Not the ſmalleſt kindneſs for it, or if it be poſſible any inclination to it muſt be ſuffered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. For this you know undid no leſs than ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Travellers to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in ancient times, and left all their carkaſſes buried in the Deſarts; who left <hi>Egypt,</hi> as you now are going to forſake the world; but it was in their Bodies only, and not in their hearts and affection. Their mouths watred ſtill at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Fleſh and Coleworts, the Garlick and Onyons: and they had a ſecret inclination which could not be long concealed to return to thoſe injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which they had abandoned. They loved the Country from whence they were departed, though they hated the bondage: And it was not ſo much the evil cuſtoms, as the cruelties of that Land, which made them ſigh for deliverance. Which is but the type and picture of thoſe perſons now, who leave their ſinful waies and practices, reſolving never to return to them; but yet they bear them a great good will, and could be very well pleaſed if they could gain a permiſſion to enjoy them, and not be damn'd to the bargain. They are often caſting a kind and favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able look towards them; it tickles them to think how happy they ſhould be if they could ſometimes keep them company, and ſuffer nothing by it. It is not their ſins that they are fallen out withall, but ſome of their followers that wait upon them: their ſmiles and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes they receive with joy; and fear nothing but the ſting which appears in the tail of them. We are wont,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101895:26"/>you know, to compare ſuch perſons to thoſe ſick men who dare not taſte of the ſalt meats, and the raw fruit which they ſee their friends eat before them, becauſe the Phyſician aſſures them, that Death lyes in ambuſh under every morſel. But they ſpeak of them with ſuch a guſt, that (as we ſay) they lick their lips at thoſe diſhes: They fancy them to be very ſavoury bits: they have a great longing for them; and the very ſcent of them is ſo delicious, that they wiſh very vehemently they were not forbidden fruit. If they think not ſometimes, that ſure a little taſte of them would do them no harm; yet they ſhould eſteem themſelves far happier men than they are, if they were not tyed to ſuch ſeverities. In ſuch ſort do thoſe Pilgrims hanker after their forſaken ſins in their former evil courſes; who hate not them, but only the miſchief which they fear from them; and are not ſo much their enemies, as friends to eaſe and a quiet conſcience. They would not forbear them, did not ſo great miſeries threaten to come along with them; and their deſires ſhould not want ſatisfaction, were they not combated with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary deſires of avoiding the trouble which that will give them. Let me tell you, it is a thouſand to one but they will find the means in ſome favourable occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to inſinuate themſelves into their ſociety again. They are not baniſhed to ſo great a diſtance, as long as they hold the place they had in their hearts; but they may be reſtored and have the liberty to return into their ancient embraces. This forced abſtinence is ſo painful, and their enjoyment is ſo ſweet, that they will live in hope of a reconciliation. The ſin and the danger will not ever ſeem ſo inſeparable. Their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections will make them ſue for a divorce, which in a Court where they are Judges may be eaſily obtained.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101895:27"/>There are many Arts of blaunching the fouleſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: And virtue doth not ſo challenge to its ſelf the ſole priviledge of being innocent, but vice will very often pretend unto it. It knows how to put it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an harmleſs dreſs; and to paſs under ſuch borrowed titles, as ſhall conceal it from the knowledge of thoſe, who are afraid of nothing but its name and its puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Love is furniſhed with as many excuſes, as it hath deſires; and is full of wit and addreſs to obtain its end. They cannot be long aſunder who are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy joyned in their affections; nor can any danger be ſo great that lyes between to divide them, but it will be ſurmounted by that which hath already overcome themſelves. So great need there is that reaſon ſhould ſee to the implanting of this paſſion which will ſo ſoon overtop it; and to provide that it be of a generous and noble ſtock, ſeeing it is like ever after to be its Lord and Maſter. It is in vain to object inconveniences to them, who know none ſo great as thoſe of being denyed their deſires. They are afraid indeed of trouble and pain, but who can tell which is the moſt grievous, that which they feel, or that which they fear? the preſent miſery of wanting what they love, or the future of induring that which they hate? Doth not the former think you touch them with a quicker ſenſe, being a preſent and a conſtant evil, and ſo moſt certain to be ſuffered: whereas the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to come, may ſeem doubtful whether it will come or no, and when it doth come, may not coſt them half that pain, which they muſt conflict withall to avoid it? It is a torment they find, to live in reſtleſs longings, but they hope it will not beſo great to give them ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. They cannot rid themſelves of the former, but they are perſwaded they may ſoon bee eaſed of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101895:27"/>latter. After they have given their deſires their full ſatisfaction, they doubt not with leſs trouble to give it to God, than they could have denied it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It is but repenting, they think, of the fact (a buſineſs of no great trouble, and ſoon over) and then God and they are both pleaſed; They by doing evil, and he by their ſorrow for what they have done. Nay, they may ſeem to have done more for Gods ſake than for their own, becauſe they enjoyed but only a ſingle pleaſure themſelves, whilſt they have indured a double torment for him: One in denying ſo long to follow their deſires, and another in their regret for following of them now. I hope then you are convinced, that for the continuance of your good <hi>Reſolution,</hi> you ought not to permit ſo much as the leaſt <hi>affection</hi> to any ſin, to go along with you. It will ſoon, you ſee, march after, if you carry ſuch a friend to it about you; and though it follow at a diſtance at the firſt, yet it will purſue you ſo hard at laſt, as ſuddenly to overtake you, or to ſpeak more truly, it will bring you back again, and cauſe you to retreat into its quarters. You muſt put your fancy therefore out of conceit with it; and poſſeſs your mind with odious repreſentations of it. You muſt loathe it, not as a ſick man doth the meats on which he hath ſurfeited, but as an healthful perſon doth thoſe to which he bears a particular an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy in his conſtitution. You muſt not abſtain from it only as a thing forbidden, but diſguſt it as that which deſerves to be forbidden.</p>
               <p>You ſee how careful I am to eſtabliſh this <hi>Reſolution</hi> in your ſoul, becauſe indeed very much depends upon it, which hath made me to enlarge this diſcourſe to a length beyond that which I intended. And truly it will coſt you ſo much pains to form it; there will ſo
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101895:28"/>many enemies oppoſe it; and perhaps when you your ſelf ſhall think that it hath ſettled it ſelf in your heart, there will be ſo much ſtill wanting to compleat it; that I have an inclination (if it will not quite tire your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience) to add a few words more about the nature of this <hi>Reſolution.</hi> You will loſe no time, I am ſure, by this means, nor ſhall I hinder you in your intended Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but as the foundation well laid doth aſſure the ſuperſtructure, and one foot firmly planted doth make the next ſtep more ſecure; ſo will the firſt part of your journey well performed, render all the reſt more eaſie and ſafe to you. It is of great avail you cannot be ignorant, in all caſes to begin well. There is nothing more imports to the happy or diſaſtrous iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of any affair, than what manner of entrance we make upon it: and therefore let me not ſeem tedious to you, if I detain you here a while before we advance further, and if I make you ſtand ſtill for a time, when you have a great mind, I believe, to be going forward.</p>
               <p>I ſubmit my ſelf to your wiſdom, ſaid the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim, and entreat you not to conſult my deſires at all, but only my Neceſſity. Or if you would be ſure to do what pleaſes me; know that you undertake an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible task, unleſs you take the liberty to ſay what you think will diſpleaſe me. If you loſe any time, it muſt be by aſking my leave to ſay your mind. I ſhall not think that you are guilty of making me ſtand ſtill, unleſs you ſtay to obtain my conſent, that you may go forward in your diſcourſe. This will be the only grievous thing that can befall me while I am in your company; and if you have a mind to exerciſe my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, it muſt be by ſuſpecting me impatient of your wholeſome counſels. Go on Sir, I beſeech you; and give me reaſons for what I am to do, but not for what
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101895:28"/>I am to hear. Tire me if you can with your Precepts, but not with any more of your Petitions to me.</p>
               <p>You ſhall have no cauſe hereafter, replyed the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector,</hi> to complain of that matter; For a pledge of which promiſe you ſhall receive no other anſwer to what you have ſaid, but only this new promiſe; That if I cannot ſerve you by the truth of what I ſay, yet the liberty and freedom of my ſpeech ſhall make you know that I intend to do you ſervice by revealing to you my very heart.</p>

               <head type="sub">A more particular Diſcourſe of <hi>Reſolution:</hi> and of the manner how to form ſuch an one as will be ſound and firm.</head>
               <p>LEt it be obſerved then, that the placing of this Diſcourſe concerning <hi>Reſolution</hi> at the end of my other Counſels was not without deſign; for I would give you to underſtand, that it is not of any worth if it be not uſhered in by precedent conſideration. This muſt lead the way, or elſe no ſolid purpoſes will follow after. You muſt firſt be well acquainted with your duty, before you can reſolve to contract a perpetual friendſhip with it. Do not think that this is a note too trivial and vulgar to have a place among my inſtructions; for I tell you truly, there are but too many, who when they are beſt diſpoſed, will reſolve to do they know not what: who make large promiſes of thoſe things, for the performance of which they are furniſhed with little power, leſs will, and ſcarce any knowledge at all. They will undertake a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101895:29"/>Pilgrimage to the <hi>Holy Land</hi> before they know a foot of the way, or make enquiry how far it is thither. They will levy war againſt an enemy, of whoſe numbers, ſtrength and policy they are utterly ignorant. And what wonder then is it, if they afterward let fall an enterprize that was begun raſhly, and to which they were not carried by their judgment, but hurried by their blind and precipitant paſſion. Of this ſort the man in the Goſpel ſeems to have been, who ſaid at the firſt word, that he would go whither his Father bade him, but afterward his fervour cooled, and he thought good to take his eaſe and reſt himſelf. I fancy ſuch a perſon to bear ſome reſemblance to a Child, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving offended his Father, comes and falls upon his knees for a pardon, to the grant of which the good man is already inclined. But then he ſaith, My Son, you muſt be careful hereafter of your duty in ſuch things as I ſhall require a proof of your obedience; and I muſt injoyn you ſuch a courſe of life as will keep you in my favour, and finally leave you my bleſſing. And before he can have finiſhed half a ſentence of what he hath to give him in charge, the youth takes the words out of his mouth, and replyes, Yes Sir, All ſhall be punctually done which you deſire. You ſhall never take me in any fault again, nor have cauſe to complain of my diſobedience. I am reſolved to be as obſervant of you in every thing, as any Child in the world can be. Let me but have your pardon, and doubt not of my conformity to your pleaſure. But all this while it is the pardon upon which he hath fixed his mind, and he hath ſo little regard to the conditions upon which it is to be beſtowed, that he hath not the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to hear them particularly remembred. The joy which he conceives from the hope of his Fathers
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:101895:29"/>love, throws him headlong into a conſent, before he conſider the inſtances, wherein the fincerity of his heart will be tryed and brought to the teſt. Theſe may prove as croſs to his will, as to enjoy his Fathers good affection is agreeable to it: and that which was ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily reſolved, will not be ſo ſpeedily put in execution. Though he fancied that he would not ſtick at a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand things to pleaſe his Father; yet when he hears them named, perhaps there is not one of them that will be ſo pleaſing to himſelf, as to find him ready to performance. Such truly are the motions which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men feel in their ſouls while the treaty is managed between God and them concerning their return to him to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> They are very glad to hear of a truce; and their hearts leap for joy to think of returning into his favour, and ſeeing his face in that Royal City. As long as the Propoſals run in general terms, that they muſt do the will of God, and run the waies of his Commandments, they find no difficulty to accord him his deſires. They readily yield to ſubmit to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and ſay, it is pity they ſhould live who will not ſerve ſuch a Maſter. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is a place of ſuch glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that while their thoughts poſt thither, they eaſily leap over all the difficulties which are in their way to it. But if you deſcend from hence to thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar differences which have been between Heaven and them; if you ſtop them a while in their Carriere, to acquaint them ſeverally with every thing that will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their patience in the journey: They appear as deſirous in ſome caſes to retain their own will, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſeemed forward in all to be reſigned to his; and it is manifeſt there are ſome courſes to which their hearts are more wed, than to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> They do not like things ſo well in the pieces, as in the lump.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101895:30"/>They do with their duty as men do with bitter Pills which they can ſwallow whole; but if they chaw them, prove ſo diſtaſtful, that they are ready to ſpit them out again. Theſe good motions indeed enjoy the name of holy purpoſes, and men think that now their hearts are fully ſet towards God; but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve rather to be called <hi>Natural Propenſions,</hi> than <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Purpoſes;</hi> and are to be eſteemed the <hi>Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the ſoul, rather than the <hi>Reſolution.</hi> For the forming therefore of this, I muſt leave with you theſe <hi>three</hi> directions, in which I ſhall comprize the ſafeſt advice that I can think of in a buſineſs of this moment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> You muſt know, that a good <hi>Reſolution</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver founded, but upon a particular conſideration of every thing that is undertaken by you; after you have weighed them, and propoſed them to your will ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, one by one. And therefore you having it in your heart to go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> think ſeriouſly how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mile it is thither, and get an exact information of every ſtep of your way to it; Set down in writing every thing that is to be done, and all the events which are like to meet you in every ſtage; and then as you go along in gour meditation, aſk your heart if it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like no paſſage, and will not be tempted in ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences to turn aſide. Remonſtrate to it, that in ſuch a place your appetite will be tempted with Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al entertainments; and pray it to deal freely with you, and declare whether it can deny to it inordinate ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. Tell your heart, that before you have gone many paces more, the wants of a poorer man than your ſelf will ſollicite your charity, and deſire to know if it can do good, and truſt God for the repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. Repreſent to it how highly you may be provoked at the next ſtep by the inſolence of ſome
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101895:30"/>unruly Traveller, and demand whether the paſſion of anger can ſuffer a bridle to be put upon it. And ſo laying before your eyes all the paths of Sobriety, Righteouſneſs, and Godlineſs, which I may hereafter mark and chalk out for you, ask your heart, What doſt thou think? What doſt thou conclude upon a ſerious view of all the way to life? Shall we conſent to take this courſe? Or ſhall we balk ſome of theſe paths? What ſay'ſt thou? Shall we be ſober in our opinions of things, in our thoughts of our ſelves, in our deſires, in our angers, in our eating and drinking (with all the reſt which you muſt enumerate)? ſhall we walk in peaceableneſs, and in patience, and in humility, and in purity? or ſhall we ſhun ſome of theſe wayes and divert into the oppoſite rode? Speak out and let me know thy mind. Which of theſe doſt thou except againſt, or muſt we equally approve of all? And never ceaſe to put theſe and ſuch like queſtions diſtinctly to your heart, till it give an expreſs conſent to every thing that preſſes for a reſolution.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But then <hi>Secondly,</hi> after this is done, you muſt proceed to conſider and make choice of every thing you intend to undertake with all its appendant incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, and evils which come along with it: Or elſe when they ſhall come to face you, your reſolution will ſtart back in ſo unexpected an encounter. Enquire therefore into all the difficulties of every part of your way: conſider the length of the miles, the danger of theevs, the badneſs of the weather, the ſcorching heat of the Sun, the ſtorms and tempeſts which may ariſe when you croſs the ſea, the hard lodging, the coarſe diet, and all the miſchiefs which I ſhall ſhortly ſhow you do attend a way ſo little frequented as that to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Say to your ſelf, Will you be abſtemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101895:31"/>from all the pleaſures which others riot in; when, beſides the want of their mirth, you your ſelf will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſubject of it, and be expoſed to their ſcorn and laughter? When your meekneſs is called cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, can you then curb your anger? If you be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a poor condition, and become the object of that charity which others have received from your hands, can you then believe and not be diſcouraged? Will you ſtill have a good opinion of your choice when you are vilified and condemned for it? Will you pretend to the ſtrictneſs of this pious courſe when it procures you nothing but mocks and flouts? Nay will you hold your way, when you are loaden with ſtripes? Will you march on with a chain about your leg, or a rope about your neck? Do not truſt your ſouls till they have made you a poſitive anſwer to theſe demands, and given you ſatisfaction; that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all you may ſuffer in your credit, in your purſe, in your body and in your life, they will not alter their purpoſe of going in theſe wayes to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and the <hi>City of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And then in the <hi>laſt</hi> place, it will much conduce to the ſetling of a conſtant <hi>Reſolution,</hi> if you do not conclude too ſoon, but weigh all theſe things over again. Ask your ſelf the next morning, whether you ſtill continue in the ſame mind. Know of your ſoul, whether your purpoſe was not the effect of a preſent heat, and if after the cool of the night you can allow it. Bid it compare all things deliberately on both ſides, and laying them in an equal ballance, ſo incline and determine it ſelf. On that ſide there are many plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which you muſt forego; and on this are many pains which you muſt indure. There is a ſoft and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate way, and here are ſtony and cragged paths. In
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101895:31"/>the other rode you may enjoy your eaſe; but in this that I ſhew you, you muſt deny your ſelf, and labour hard to be ſaved. Do not the ſcales incline to the contrary ſide? Will you ſtill be in love with this rough way which leads to <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> What have you now at hand to counterpoiſe and to weigh down the advantages which ſeem to lye on the other ſide againſt your Reſolution? You are undone, if you are not furniſhed with a multitude of ſuch conſiderations as theſe, of the worth and weight of a ſoul, of the Glory of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of the pleaſures that you ſhall ſoon taſte in theſe ragged waies; which you muſt throw into the right-hand ſcale with all the force of reaſon you have. Or in one word, you muſt compare the <hi>Beginning</hi> and the <hi>End</hi> of theſe two together, and then you will ſoon ſee the difference. There is nothing, you think, but ſweetneſs in the waies which I forbid you, till you come to the concluſion of your journey, and then what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion will you find made for you but gall and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood? As on the other ſide you may fancy, there is nothing grows but that bitter herb in the paths wherein I would conduct you; yet at the laſt how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you cannot but promiſe your ſelf a Garden of pleaſure. Now, which of theſe will you make your choice; to which of them will you lean; to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or to the future good? To the preſent, no doubt, if you be a beaſt; but to the future ſure, if you be a man, and not forſaken of your reaſon. For, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to compare the <hi>Length</hi> of theſe two; and ſee how far it is from the beginning of the pleaſures in one way, and the pains in the other, to the end of both. Is it not a very ſhort life of a few daies, which puts a period to them both? How can it be any great matter then to enjoy the one, or to endure the other? But
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101895:32"/>then where theſe end, there is ſomething elſe begins, and who can tell the length of that, when the other are done and paſſed away? Now the diſparity diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it ſelf. Now your thoughts will be ſwallowed up in a bottomleſs Abyſſe. For you can ſee no end of the pleaſures to which one way leads you, nor of the pains to which the other brings you. So that you may let your Soul know, that this is the ſumm of the whole buſineſs. Here are on one hand ſhort plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and long pains; and on the other, ſhort pains, and long pleaſures. Bid it chuſe now, like a rational creature, and embrace that which draws the will with greateſt force unto it. I am ſure, there is nothing can tempt it to incline to the former, but only this, that thoſe pleaſures are preſent whereas theſe that I ſpeak of are to come. Let it therefore never conſider them as meer pleaſures, but with this addition of <hi>Short</hi> and <hi>Long;</hi> and that will render the difference vaſtly great, and attract it mightily to the other hand. And if the ſcale ſeem to alter again, becauſe you are ſure of the preſent, but not of that which is to come; Here you muſt employ your <hi>Faith,</hi> to give a weight to that which is not yet in Being. It muſt make you feel how ſolid and maſſy thoſe future enjoyments are, and then your work is done. For when Faith hath made them <hi>preſent</hi> as the other are; they themſelves are ſo <hi>ponderous,</hi> that it will ſeem as leight as feathers, whatſoever it be that lyes in the ballance againſt them.</p>
               <p>I believe you ſee by this time, that it is a matter of ſome labour, to bring your ſelf to a thorow <hi>Reſolution:</hi> but when it ſtands on theſe grounds, I do not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend what temptation that ſhould be, which can hope to ſhake it. There is no new thing can preſent it ſelf,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101895:32"/>but what hath been already conſidered, and for which you are provided: and therefore it will diſpair ſure (being clearly caſt, and having loſt the day) of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering any place in your eſteem, or being of any moment hereafter with you. Its pretenſions being quite ſpoiled, and all that it hath to alledge confuted; it will be to no purpoſe again to ſollicite an heart which hath ſo ſolemnly given it a repulſe, and utterly rejected its ſuit. One thing indeed muſt not here be diſſembled; which is the great difference that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears between the ſame thing, while it remains in the ſpeculation of our mind, and when it comes forth from thence to be put in practice. The diſtance is wide, it muſt be confeſſed between thoughts and things. It is not all one to conceive and to bring forth, to diſcourſe and to paſs to execution. There is a great deal of pleaſure attends upon our conceptions; and clear reaſonings are accompanied with a wonderful delight. There we eaſily maſter deſigns; and fighting only with the Idaeas of things, they will ſuffer themſelves to be conquered by us, and taken captives at our wills. But then, after all this, we muſt come out to the other part of executing and bringing forth; and there we find a ſtronger reſiſtance. Then the faces of things are quite changed, and the Soul falls into labour, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the throws of travel. It is not the ſame thing for a Merchant to think of a ſtorm, and to be driven with the fury of it. A tempeſt is not ſo frightful in the Port, as in the midſt of the Sea. Then it is that perhaps he repents of his Voyage, and wiſhes that he was well at home again: Or, at leaſt, he could be content to be driven thither, and there think he had done nobly in venturing ſo far as he did upon the treacherous Ocean. And ſo truly, I cannot tell you how great the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101895:33"/>may be which you will find between your ſelf hereafter when you come to do theſe things, and your ſelf now when you are deliberating of them. We are now in a place of reſt and peace; we ſpeak of things abſent, and diſcourſe of objects afar off: when you and your enemies come to be upon the ſame ſpot, when you are engag'd to do what you have in deſign, then you may not be the ſame man, nor find things in the ſame poſture: But that may revolt and oppoſe you in the operation, which was compliant to you in thought, or did not ſo much reſiſt you in meditation. Then you will find that you muſt wraſtle ſtoutly with the difficulties that make head againſt you, and that they will put you to a greater proof of your valour and conſtancy than you might imagine. Then your caſe will be very bad if you feel your ſelf more unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to proceed, than now you are: if you muſt be combating your own will, when you ſhould ſet upon your enemies; if you muſt then be deliberating, when you ſhould be doing; and prevailing over your ſelf, when you ſhould carry the victory over your oppoſers. And if you ſhould prove like our <hi>Hypocrits,</hi> who think it is enough to reſolve ſtoutly, and to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, your affairs will ſtill be in a worſe condition: For then you will fairly go back, and ſit down to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort your ſelf with ſuch thoughts as theſe; That you have gone far enough in undertaking a buſineſs of ſuch difficulty, though you never effect it; and that it is an atchievement glorious enough for this world, to ſet your ſelf againſt enemies ſo mighty, though they get the better of you. Thus flatterers have ſometimes praiſed a Princes valour, for having once put his horſe into a rage; and extolled his courage for ſigning a Treaty of Peace with a great deal of regret.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:101895:33"/>
               <p>That you may be conſtant therefore and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in your <hi>Reſolution;</hi> that not you, but your enemies may yield and leave you the victory; let me earneſtly beſeech you to repreſent all things which you now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake both as truly and naturally; and as lively and ſtrongly as it is poſſible to your ſoul. Think that you are now iſſuing forth into the field of action. That at this moment you are in the agonies which you muſt expect. That juſt now when you are deliberating of theſe things, you feel all the contradiction and reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that will be made. And for the better ſecurity of your <hi>Reſolution,</hi> it will be uſeful, if not neceſſary, to renew it every morning; and to go out of your Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber armed as a man that waits for his enemies. Vow your heart again unto God as ſoon as you open your eyes. Make a ſolemn proteſtation before him, that you mean to continue his faithful ſervant, and for no reaſon in the world to be falſe to your undertaking. Reproach to your ſelf the baſeneſs and cowardice of which you have been at any time guilty; and ſwear to him over and over again your conſtant fidelity. Say with a great courage, I do here in the preſence of God, and of my Saviour, and of all the heavenly Hoſt devote all the forces of my ſoul to execute his pleaſure. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the world; I vow a Pilgrimage to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> I will wade thorow all difficulties; I will refuſe no labours; I will beg my bread ſo I may come ſafely thither. This I avow to be my mind; this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and ratifie again without any reſervations, clauſes or exceptions. I will never unſay it, nor revoke it. I will never repent of this promiſe, or of any part of it. So help me, O my God. And here it will be ſeaſonable to make your humble ſuit unto him, that he wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Repreſent to him that you are a poor Pilgrim, who have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken a long journey for his ſake, and forſaken all for no other end, but only to ſee him at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And therefore tell him you hope he will not ſuffer your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to miſcarry; but that he will make you as valiant in your actions, as through his goodneſs you are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in mind and heart: and that as you have choſen this way, ſo he will uphold your goings in his paths, that your footſteps ſlip not. Shew him all your weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and how fearful you are of your ſelf. Tell him you are ſenſible the doing of his will, is much different from knowing and purpoſing to do it. And therefore pray that he will leſſen the difference, or take it quite away by his mighty power joyned to you, that you may with as much certainty, if not with as much eaſe, do and effect, as you have projected and reſolved. In ſhort, offer up your will to him all broken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite, that he may put it into what form and poſture he pleaſes. Shew him an heart that quits all intereſt in it ſelf, and that would be only led and conducted by him. Let him ſee you ſtanding quite out of your own will; purely indifferent to all things, but only the doing of his. Let him know that you mean never to call it back, or to reſume it into your hands any more, though you might poſſeſs it of all the world thereby. And then ſure he cannot abandon you, nor ſuffer any thing elſe to make a prey of that which is thus affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionately addreſſed unto him. It is not poſſible that he ſhould refuſe the offering you make him, nor can he throw away a heart which puts it ſelf thus humbly and ſincerely into his hands; for now it is in the place where he would have it, and it doth but anſwer the ſummons of ſurrender which he ſent it. He doth not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101895:34"/>deſire any thing more, than that you would thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and make over your ſelf to him, willing neither one thing nor other but only this, that he would let you know what choice to make for your ſelf: Then you cannot be long ignorant of your duty, nor impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent neither; for your Will being overcome, you will ſoon overmaſter all other difficulties, either of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or doing the will of God.</p>

But if they did ſee things in a true light and were not hoodwinkt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101895:35"/>with their paſſion, they would thank us for our advice, &amp; think that we came to reſtore them a treaſure which they had loſt, and indeed till now had never injoyed.</p>
               <p>You ſhall not take my word long for what I ſay; but you ſhall find before you have travelled very far, that you was never happy till you was looſed from thoſe bonds whereby your heart was tyed to worldly things; that you was never Maſter of any thing till you was ſtript ſtark naked of all your earthly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Now you will be your own man. Now you will be able to do as you will your ſelf, and to live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your pleaſure. You will now have the power to diſpoſe of your time and your thoughts, and all things elſe belonging to you, as you ſhall think good. You will have the liberty to keep your ſelf company; to entertain your Saviour when he comes to viſit you; to enjoy God in quiet without any thing to diſturb you; to converſe with the other world as freely as you do with this. Whereas while your heart was chained to any of theſe things which I wiſh you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, I appeal to you, whether you was not more theirs, then your own. Was you not forced to go whither they would have you? Did they not draw you from your ſelf at their pleaſure? Was you not bound to keep them company; to imploy your time in their ſervice and attendance? Did they not perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ingroſs your thoughts, and ſollicite your deſires, and exclude all things elſe beſide themſelves from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any place in your heart? In ſhort, was you not ever from home, and did you not alwayes live out of your ſelf? Let not your poverty then run in your mind though it ſhould be never ſo often objected to you, for you was never poſſeſſor of any thing till now: never rich till you became a Pilgrim: never Maſter
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101895:35"/>of any thing till you was owner of your ſelf. Now you have recovered your freedom and your eaſe both together. Now you may <hi>do</hi> what you will, and you ſhall not <hi>ſuffer</hi> as you was wont. You can remember the torment I believe which you indured when any of thoſe things were either loſt or diminiſhed, to which you had ingaged your affections. You felt that if we love and cleave to any thing, we muſt be carried along with it. With all its changes (which in this uncertain world are not a few) we muſt ſuffer a change too. When it is in danger, we ſhake and tremble for fear. When it is impaired, we are wounded and cut at the heart for grief. When it is loſt, we ſcarce know where we are and cannot find ourſelves. And, in one word, we muſt follow the fortune of theſe worldly things if we be wedded to them; inſomuch, that there is no remedy but to ſue out a divorce preſently, becauſe it is an unlawful marriage. See then what an happineſs falls to your portion when this is once effected and your intereſts come to be ſeparated by parting you aſunder. Now you will not be concerned in any of the mutations of the world. Now any thing in it may depart, and not be followed with your lamentations. And, to ſpeak compendiouſly, there is nothing can go away from you, which ſhall carry you away too, but it will ſtill leave you your ſelf behind.</p>
               <p>Let me incourage you therefore to take the name and weeds of a Pilgrim upon you, as your honour; and to wear them as a glorious mark of your freedom. Though you have given your heart heretofore to the world, yet let it know that you do not intend to leave it in her hands: but preſently call it back again that you may beſtow it upon a better Maſter. Do not we ſay that every Chriſtian muſt give himſelf to God, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101895:36"/>is it not that which I have now perſwaded you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve? But how ſhall a man give that which he hath not? And he hath not himſelf as I have proved, that hath let out his heart to the world. It is neceſſary then that you take it home again in order to your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his. You muſt be your own, that ſo you may give your ſelf to him. You muſt be reſtored into your own hand, that ſo you may have ſomething to offer up to his uſes. And did you never think in any ſickneſs that you was near to the gates of Death? I beſeech you tell me whether it was not a great trouble to you to find your ſelf ſo much in the power of other things that you could not reſign your ſelf to God? What miſery is there like to this to be ſo out of our own hands while we live; that we cannot yield our ſelves to our Maker when he would have us dye? To be tyed ſo faſt to other things, that we cannot go to him when he calls us? To feel that this thing holds us, and that pulls us, and the other even claſps about us, and ſayes, You muſt not leave us? If there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to thruſt you forward in your deſign, the thoughts of this miſery would be a ſufficient ſpur to you to quicken the execution of it. Reſtore your ſelf preſently to liberty again, and be a ſervant of the world no longer; if it be but for this reaſon only, that you may be free to dye. Leave the world as you found it: And ſeeing you muſt go naked as you came, do not ſtay for Death to pluck off your clothes, but ſtrip your ſelf, and owe your liberty to your own hands. It will not be long you are well aſſured ere that debt to nature muſt be paid; and then there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a greater contentment, than to feel that you are your own at that hour: That you can diſpoſe of your ſelf to God without any lett or hindrance; and that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:101895:36"/>you can dye in the freedom wherein you were born. If you ſtand ingaged to the world; it will be ſure to put in its claim and challenge an intereſt in you at that time. It will let you know that it is your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris, and ſtill requires your ſervice. And therefore follow your reſolution and forſake it betime; that ſo it may not give you any trouble then, but ſuffer you to go out of it, as quietly and with as little care, as you came into it.</p>
               <p>He ſpake theſe words with a great deal of heat, and with a tone expreſſing ſo much vehemency, that he could not have been more earneſt if he had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the liberty of his Country with thoſe, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to betray it. But on a ſudden repreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and letting his voyce fall a little, he told him that he would ſpare the reſt of his diſcourſe on this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſome body that ſtood in greater need of it. For I perceive (ſaid he) that I have now to deal with an heart that hath already began its own deliverance, and whoſe wearineſs of the Worlds ſervice hath brought it hither to find out a better Maſter. Beſides (added he) it will not be prudent I think to burden you with many things at once: and we are admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo by the darkneſs which comes upon us, that it is time to take a ſhort repaſt and ſo commit our ſelves to reſt. I have an empty Bed which will be glad to receive a Pilgrim, or any one that hath ſet his face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> being dedicated long ago to Charity. And therefore if you intend to be ruled by me in all things, let me lay my injunctions upon you not to ſtir a foot to ſeek a lodging in any other place but in my houſe. It was a thing of no difficulty, you may eaſily think to perſwade a man to accept of that, which he much deſired, and had already prepared himſelf to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:101895:37"/>beg. And therefore having made him his hearty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments for that offer and for all the good counſels he had beſtowed upon him, together with a promiſe to be obſequious to them; they ſate down to a frugal ſupper, and a while after commending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God they parted and went to Bed. I ſay to Bed; for they did not both betake themſelves to Reſt: The poor ſtranger's mind being toſſed with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thoughts, and travelling all night very hard to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> He had no ſooner put off his clothes, but he thought that this was a lively embleme of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to which he was to be reduced; and it put him in mind how he ought to ſtrip himſelf of all affections to the world. He took there a ſolemn leave of it, and bad it eternally farewell. And think not, ſaid he, to meet me again in the morning, and that I will put on my love to you as I do my garments; No, I vow that I would go ſtark naked if the one could not be reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med without the other. Then he revolved in his mind all that he had heard of the way to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> together with the difficulties therein: which in the ſilent dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the night he muſed upon more deeply then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he would have done at another time: There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a reſemblance he thought between the darkneſs and the afflictions he was to indure; and between the ſilence, and the patience he was to uſe. Theſe and ſuch like reflections ſucceeded ſo faſt one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they would not ſuffer him to cloſe his eyes till towards the morning light: When a weak ſlumber laying all his ſenſes aſleep and chaining up his reaſon, left only his imagination at liberty to rove about. And it had not preſſed many of the footſteps of things which his memory was imprinted withall, before the image of an ancient pious friend of his, dead long ago,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101895:37"/>and who had often perſwaded him to quit the world, preſented it ſelf before him. He was clothed in white rayment, and his countenance was very bright, but he approached him with the very ſame ſmiles in his face wherewith he uſed heretofore to run into his imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. This perſon he fancied he was going to meet as ſoon as he ſaw him come in at the door; but before he could ſtir, he thought he found him at his bed-ſide praying him not to ariſe. For (ſaid he) I muſt ſoon leave you, and am come only to expreſs to you the joy I have to find you in this Good mans houſe. <hi>Happy is he that hath met with a faithful Guide; but far happier is he who follows his Advice.</hi> Make not too much haſte to be gone; ſtir not from hence till you be diſmiſſed. And then I hope we may one day meet, never to part again: But now I cannot be permitted to make a long ſtay with you. This ſight, but eſpecially his ſpeech, gave him ſuch a ſentiment of joy, that he hath often ſince profeſſed he never felt the like, nor had any power to deſcribe it. Yet he wiſhed afterward that it had been leſs; for it brought him out of his ſlumber; and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eyes, chaſed away that fair Idaea, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany he would fain have enjoyed a little longer. So agreeable was that object to him, and ſo delectable did it render that moment or two wherein it appeared, that his ſpirits were as much refreſhed thereby, as if they had been ſteeped all the night in the dews of ſleep. Not hoping therefore, nor wiſhing to have his eyes ſhut again (unleſſe it were to behold that friend) he left his Bed, and prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to welcome his Hoſt whom he heard already ſtirring and calling up his ſervants. He comforted himſelf alſo with this pleaſant thought, that he was awaked to ſee a friend, whoſe company he ſhould
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101895:38"/>not to loſe ſo ſoon, and in whoſe ſociety he might rejoyce without fearing to make him vaniſh out of his ſight.</p>

               <head type="sub">He commends to the Pilgrim, two Companions: <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> Directs where to find them. With a large Diſcourſe of the former of them.</head>
               <p>IT was not long before the Good man of the houſe came to give him the uſual morning ſalutations, and to inquire how he had reſted that night. But when he entred his Chamber he beheld ſuch a joy in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, that it quite turned by that thought, and made him congratulate his chearfulneſs, which he told him he took as a certain indication, that his Counſels had found a good acceptance, and were like to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued. His Gueſt was willing that he ſhould impute his pleaſant aſpect to that cauſe, and ſo told him nothing of his dream: Fearing indeed that he might think him childiſh and ſuperſtitious, if he knew that he conceived ſo much joy from ſuch ſleight appearances and ſhadows of comfort. But having expreſſed his great ſatisfaction in thoſe preparatory diſcourſes wherewith he had been pleaſed to honour him; he told him that the New day was not ſo welcome as himſelf, and that the Hours ſeemed too ſluggiſh, and the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make over-long delay, to bring him the reſt of of the Counſels which he expected from his mouth, You have given me a rare <hi>Good-morrow,</hi> replyed the Guide, and I have ſeldome met with ſuch early joys: Let us give thanks to God therefore for this happy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101895:38"/>and ſo qualifie our ſelves for the continuance of his favours. The poor Pilgrim (for ſo he eſteemed himſelf) imbraced this pious motion with all his heart; and ſo having joyned together in their devout ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments, the one prepared himſelf to ſpeak, and the other to hear what further related to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Journey to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And the Sky being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clear, the Earth having charged the Air with no vapours at all, they were invited into the fields, at once to refreſh their bodies with a walk, and their minds with good diſcourſe. Conſidering alſo the ſecurity they ſhould enjoy thereby from all the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that other company might give them; it was agreed, that all the time he ſtayed there, if the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were favourable, they ſhould ſpend the greateſt part of the day abroad. You will expect, perhaps, that I ſhould ſet down at large the particulars of every dayes conference, and tell you where the night broke it off, and with what circumſtances it was renewed the next morning; but I fear that method would extend my narrative to too great a length: And therefore I ſhall content my ſelf to give you a continued Relation of the principal things which at ſeveral times enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained our Pilgrim, during his ſtay with this good man; whoſe charity would not ſuffer him to depart, till he was fully inſtructed in all things that concerned his ſafe paſſe to the <hi>City of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon then as they had the houſe on their backs, and were come into the open Air, the Guide began to ſpeak unto him to this effect. I will not be ſo diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of your memory, as to make a repetition of what hath been already ſaid, but proceed to tell you, that having diſpoſed your affairs in ſuch ſort as I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101895:39"/>and put your ſelf in good order for your Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, you muſt be ſure to provide your ſelf of two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions to go along with you, which indeed you can never be without, whoſe names are HUMILITY and CHARITY. The former of theſe will alwayes keep you in a mean opinion of your ſelf, and the latter will raiſe you to an high eſteem of God and your Saviour, breeding in you a paſſionate deſire to be like to them, and a grateful reſentment of all their kindneſs to you. And that you may not think I intend to put you upon ſome long ſearch for them, I ſhall tell you for your comfort, that you ſhall find them both lodged toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one place from whence they never ſtir, but are alwayes ready at hand to aſſiſt thoſe that there ſeek for them. I know you are deſirous that I ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you where that is, and becauſe I would ſave your pains as much as ever I can, I ſhall ſend you no further than your ſelf, if you ſtill keep in mind that ſentence which I told you would be of daily uſe, and which you requeſted to have explained; for in that you will be ſure to meet them embracing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in an inſeparable conjunction. You do well, I hope, remember it; yet I cannot chuſe but repeat it to you, and wiſh you again &amp; again to ſay as affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as you are able, <hi>I am nought, I have nought, I deſire nought, but only this one thing, which is our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and to be in peace with him at Jeruſalem.</hi> HUMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LITY ſayes, <hi>I am nought, I have nought.</hi> And LOVE ſayes, <hi>I deſire nought but Jeſus and Jeruſalem.</hi> Theſe two you may the better keep in your company, becauſe you cannot loſe either of them, unleſs you will loſe them both; (and who is there that would not at leaſt have one friend to be of his ſociety in his travels?) So loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they do agree together, that they are by no means
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101895:39"/>willing to be aſunder. If the one be admitted, the other will not be excluded; and as the one grows to a taller pitch, the other advances together with it. The more you humble your ſelf, the higher will your Love aſcend; and as that is exalted, ſo will you learn ſtill lower to depreſs your ſelf. For the more you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern your ſelf to be nothing, with the greater ardency of affection will you embrace Jeſus, who is deſirous to make you ſomething worth: and the more you admire and love him &amp; his incomparable perfections, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtill will you be able to take a view of your own nothing. And that is a thing which I think fit to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to you before we paſs any further, becauſe it may be of great uſe unto you in your Pilgrimage. That the <hi>Humility</hi> which I commend unto you, is not to be exerciſed ſo much in a direct conſidering of your ſelf, your ſinfulneſs and your miſery; (though this be very profitable at the firſt) as in a ſtill, quiet and loving ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the excellent Goodneſs, Purity and Love of Jeſus. When you believe him to have the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelling in him bodily, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when you are indued with a ſavoury feeling of his holineſs and kindneſs; this ſight of him will beget in your ſoul a more pure, ſpiritual and ſweet <hi>Humility,</hi> than the beholding of your ſelf can poſſibly do, which produces an <hi>Humility</hi> more groſs, boiſterous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet. As there is a <hi>Love</hi> which is calm and quiet, when not at all ſtirr'd with the paſſion, we remain poſſeſſed of all the pleaſure of it; So is there an <hi>Humility</hi> of the ſame nature, which ſilently ſinks us down to the very bottom of our being, without ſtirring and troubling of our ſouls, as we are wont to do when we violently plunge our thoughts into them. But both of theſe deſcend from above, when our minds are faſtned to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101895:40"/>caeleſtial objects, which alwayes are in a ſerene tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity: they will not ſpring from things beneath, which are toſſed in a perpetual and reſtleſs agitation. We never ſeem leſs in our own eyes, than when we look down from an high upon our ſelves: and being then in peace, we have leſs alſo of that vexation wherein our ſouls are apt to boil and rage when they are the neareſt objects of our thoughts. Our <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> will be the more when we admire Jeſus; and it will be of a temper more mild and gentle, like him whom we admire. It will not loſe any thing of it ſelf by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king its original from him; but only loſe that ſowre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is mingled with it when it hath its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from our ſelves. You will plainly underſtand my meaning, if you do but conſider, that by fixing your eyes upon your ſelf, you may indeed diſcern that you are a moſt wretched, ſinful creature: but by faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them upon him, you will both ſee the ſame, and that more clearly; and moreover feel that you are a meer nothing. This ſenſe of your ſelf, which layes you loweſt of all other, you can never owe to any thing elſe, but a ſight of him who wants nothing. His Fulneſs appearing ſo great, your Emptineſs will ſeem as vaſt; and in compare with his Perfections, you will think your ſelf nothing but Imperfection. When you conſider that all is his, at that thought you have loſt your ſelf, by finding that you are not your own: and when you think that he is the original of all, you are loſt again in a ſenſe that you had been nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him. So that in this way you will be as much caſt down to the ground, and rolled as much in the duſt, as by any other reflections: All the difference is, that you will not roll and tumble about in the turbulency of your own diſtracted thoughts, and the violent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:101895:40"/>of your furious paſſions. You will only lye at his feet in a lowly poſture, adoring of his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, praiſing his ſurpaſſing Perfections, confeſſing your own meanneſs, beſeeching him to pity a poor Soul that thinks it ſelf nothing, unleſs it may ſee him there, and deſiring him to take the opportunity of doing himſelf that honour, and you that kindneſs, as out of his fulneſs to impart a new ſpirit, and a divine nature to you. Nay this <hi>Humility</hi> will make you ſtudy to caſt all other things out of your thoughts, and labour only to be beloved of him, without which you judge your ſelf to be of all creatures moſt miſerable. It is not to be told what the benefits of this ſort of <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> are: but to let you ſee ſomething of its great vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, reflect upon that which we lately diſcourſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the force of a ſtrong Reſolution, and hearty ſurrender of your ſelf to God. Which as it contains all things you are to do with in its comprehenſion, ſo it is ſupported by nothing more than a profound <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> When we conſider that we were made by God, that we depend upon him every moment, that we are infinitely ingaged to him for many millions of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; when we think what a Soveraign Authority he hath over us, how much he is ſuperiour to us, what a right he hath to all our ſervices, and how wiſe and good his will is; it is impoſſible that we ſhould avoid reſolving to give him our hearts, and to perſiſt eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the abnegation of our own wills and deſires, which we can never ſuffer to be competitors with his. This <hi>Humility</hi> will not be forward to cloathe you with ſhirts of hair, to preſcribe you no other dyet but the meaneſt you can procure, to put a whip into your hand wherewith to let your ſelf blood, to rob you of your hoſe and ſhooes, that you may go barefoot to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:101895:41"/>
                  <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> It will not bid you ſtrike your bare breaſt againſt the ſtones, nor tell you, that to be a <hi>Saint,</hi> you muſt roll your naked body in the briers, or tumble in the ſame manner in heaps of Winter Snow, or plunge your ſelf up to the neck in an Icy Pool: But it will infallibly ſtrip you of your ſelf, and ſtarve all your carnal deſires, and break your will in pieces, and lay you at the foot of the Croſs of Chriſt, and diſpoſe you to all thoſe rigours, and a thouſand more if your Lord did ſignifie that he would be pleaſed with ſuch auſterities.</p>
               <p>How ſafe then and ſecure muſt you needs think your ſelf under the conduct of ſuch a Companion? you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have a better Guard, nor be put into a place of greater aſſurance, if you ſeek over all the world for it, than that to which <hi>Humility</hi> will lead you. For making you diſtruſtful of your own power and ſtrength, it will urge you to a continual dependance upon your Lord, without whom you feel that nothing, much leſs ſuch an excellent thing as you deſign can be atchieved. We accuſe very much the weakneſs of our nature, we complain heavily of the body of fleſh and blood, which continually betrayes us, we conceit that we ſhould do rare things, were we but once quit of this load of earth, and ſuffered to move in the free and yielding Air. But let me tell you, and believe it for a truth; though we had no ſociety with a terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial nature; nay, though our minds were free and clear from all mortal concretion, though we had no cloathes at all to hinder our motion; yet our ruine might ariſe out of our ſpirits, and by pride and ſelf-confidence we might throw our ſelves down into utter deſtruction. For what commerce, I pray you, had
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:101895:41"/>the Apoſtate Angels with our corporeal nature? what familiarity with a body? Do we not conceive them to have been pure ſpirits ſeparated from all earthly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion? And yet by placing all in themſelves, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puffed up in their own thoughts, and not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging their need of the Divine preſence and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, we conclude that they tumbled themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Abyſſe of miſery and woe irrecoverable. Now they are in a worſe condition then if they were ſpirits of a ſmaller ſize: Now the torment they ſuffer is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the nobleneſs of their nature. For the ſharper and quicker the mind is, and the greater its indowments are which it hath received; the greater miſchief doth it bring upon it ſelf, and the ſadder are its perplexities when it is deſtitute of the ſpecial help and preſence of God. As a great Giant being blinded muſt needs ſtumble more grievouſly, and give himſelf ſorer knocks then he would have done, if he had not been of ſo huge a bulk: So a mind and reaſon eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to an higher pitch then others, is carried headlong into an heavier ruine, when it is deprived of that Divine light which is neceſſary for its guidance and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Excellency of nature therefore little profits if God be not preſent with it, and he abſents himſelf from all, that place not their ſtrength, ſufficiency and ſafeguard in him, but in themſelves. And on the other ſide Fragility of nature is not that which will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do us if the Divine preſence do not withdraw it ſelf, which it never doth from humble and lowly minds that confide in him and not in their own power, which were it a thouſand times greater then it is, would not be ſufficient to conſerve it ſelf. Our pride and vanity and forgetfulneſs of God then is that which we muſt accuſe; not the infirmity and crazineſs of our fleſh;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101895:42"/>for as the excellency of the Angelical nature could not ſave them when they disjoyned themſelves from their Creator: So the weakneſs of ours ſhall not harm us, if we keep cloſe to him and never ſever our ſelves from that heavenly power which worketh mightily in us. Do you not ſee then how much you muſt ſtand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to this Aſſociate in your journy? For it is <hi>Humility</hi> that muſt faſten you to God, that will keep you in a conſtant adherence to him, and not let you ſtir a foot from him; that will make you tremble to think of looking into your ſelf and not behold him there. This is in effect your ſtrength and ſalvation; this ſupplies the defects of your nature; this is the remedy of your infirmity; and after a ſtrange way this raiſes you above all the power of the world, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you down and preſſing you very low in your own thoughts.</p>
               <p>I muſt not defraud it therefore of thoſe juſt praiſes that are due to its vertue, which may recommend it more to your affection and make its company more grateful in your travels. But it is fit you ſhould know that this <hi>humility</hi> which makes us ſeem ſo little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in our own eyes, is one of the moſt glorious things in the world, and places a man among the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Hero's.</hi> It is indeed the height and ſublimity of our mind, the true Gallantry of our ſpirits. It letting us ſee what poor deſpicable things we are, cauſes us to ſurmount our ſelves and to have no regard to ſuch low and petty intereſts as thoſe of our own. It is not a ſneaking quality, that diſpirits the ſoul and deprives it of all its force and vigor, but a generous diſpoſition of mind, that will not ſuffer it to imploy its forces upon ſuch a mean and contemptible ſervice as that of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:101895:42"/>our ſelves. Let it not ſeem a Paradox to you, for there is nothing truer, that Pride and conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are the qualities of baſe bred ſouls, of feeble and ignoble minds; and that lowlineſs is the indowment of a ſoul well born, nobly deſcended, and bravely edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the knowledge of the moſt excellent things. For whether is greater I pray you, he that ſets a value upon little trifles, or he that deſpiſes them? Is not he that deſpiſes them? whoſe thoughts are taken up with ſublimer objects that make himſelf and all things here beſides appear as nothing in his eyes. I believe you will ſay there was not a greater man in the world in thoſe dayes then <hi>Moſes,</hi> a leader of a mighty people, the Captain General of all the Pilgrims of that Age, who had wrought wonders in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> who had ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized himſelf by the drowning of <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Army in the Sea:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>V. Chryſt. in</hi> 1 Cor. 1.3.</note> and yet it is apparent there was not a meeker perſon living upon the earth: no man had a meaner opinion of himſelf. He was content to be taught by <hi>Jethro</hi> though he knew ſo much himſelf; nay he was not offended at his reprehenſion, but ſubmitted his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a better reaſon. Could there be a greater inſtance of his Humility and Gallantry both together? He that had overcome ſo many, now overcame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He that had triumphed over mighty hoſts, now leads his pride in Triumph and tramples it under his feet. He cared not who had the honour of it, ſo wiſe and great things were effected. His own glory he valued not, but his <hi>Humility</hi> inſpired him by all means to ſeek the peoples good. What think you of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> alſo a more ancient Pilgrim then this? who calls himſelf but Duſt and Aſhes; who condeſcended ſo far as to pray <hi>Lot</hi> a perſon inferiour to himſelf, that there might be no difference between them: And yet this
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:101895:43"/>was that great man who had overcome ſo many Kings in battle, and brought away ſo many ſpoils, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed <hi>Lot</hi> himſelf from Captivity. Hath not his Humility rendred him more famous then thoſe victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? Hath he not crowned himſelf with greater glory in not vaunting himſelf in thoſe Trophies, then if he had been ſerved continually by thoſe conquered Princes? If one man thinks clay to be clay and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore treads upon it; another thinks it to be gold and therefore admires it; which of theſe hath the braver mind? Hath not he who doth not admire the clay and embrace the dirt? So he truly that calls himſelf but Duſt and Aſhes hath certainly a very great ſoul; while he that underſtandeth not but hath himſelf in admiration is a weak and baſely minded man. He hath a great ſpirit who makes no account of thoſe things which others are proud of. He is generous who deſpiſes things far greater than thoſe, which others eſteem the marks of their glory: who doth not ſwell with high atchievements when his envious neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are puffed up with every trifle. <hi>Humility</hi> then you ſee is not ſheepineſs, but loftineſs of mind and the moſt elevated pitch of the ſoul. It is not dejected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit, but a raiſed underſtanding of God and of our ſelves. And therefore let us be low (as one of the ancient Guides of the Church adviſes) that we may be high. If we admire any thing here, let it be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity of humble minds.</p>
               <p>I cannot conclude before I add for your further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement, that <hi>Humility</hi> is of an excellent good nature and hath a ſingular obligingneſs in its conſtitution. It makes us no leſs acceptable unto men then unto God, and renders us amiable though we have nothing elſe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101895:43"/>to give us any advantage. Do you not ſee how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable the Proud are? and what is the reaſon of it, but becauſe they ſcorn thoſe who are not of their rank? They cannot be obliged becauſe they think whatſoever you do is due to their merit. They would be loved by all, without loving again. They will command in all companies, and have every one yield to their humors. They will teach all and learn of none. They are incapable of gratitude, and think you are honoured enough for your ſervices, if they do but receive them. They would draw all to themſelves, and are unacquainted with that which charms all the world, I mean bounty and liberality. The Humble man no doubt then is the moſt agreeable perſon upon earth; whom you oblige by a good word, which he thinks he doth not deſerve: who thanks you for the ſmalleſt courteſie: who had rather obey then rule: who is deſirous to learn of the meaneſt Scholler: who contemns no body but himſelf: who loves though he be not loved: who thinks nothing too much to do for thoſe that eſteem him: and who is afraid he hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver recompenced enough the civilities which are done unto him. In ſhort, this <hi>Humility</hi> is of ſuch great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and ſo good natured, that there is nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to it but its twin ſiſter, Divine <hi>Charity.</hi> This amiable pair are like the right foot and the left by which the traveller performs his journey. There needs no more but this happy couple to carry you through all the paths of piety and bring you ſafe to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Let us turn our eyes then if you pleaſe from the one to the other, and look a while upon the beauty and graces of <hi>Charity,</hi> whoſe charms are ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful that you cannot chuſe but open to it your em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Divine <hi>Charity.</hi> The Power that it hath both to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh his Reſolution, and furniſh him with all other Requiſites for his Journey.</head>
               <p>ANd that which will very much inamour you at the firſt glance, is the power which you will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in it to eſtabliſh your Reſolution, and to make it ſo firm, that it ſhall not be ſhaken by all the force of all the world, which is nothing ſo ſtrong and mighty as <hi>Love.</hi> I know this touches you with a ſtrong incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to it, if you have any mind to offer your will to God as I adviſed; and therefore you will not think I importune you with a tedious diſcourſe, if I make you more ſenſible of this following truth. That <hi>Love</hi> makes one will of two, and cauſes us to ſacrifice all our own deſires to the will of that we love, if we eſteem it better than our ſelves. For what, I pray you, can we ſay of Love, but which a wiſer man than you or I hath told us, who calls it <hi>that emotion of the ſoul whereby we joyn our ſelves in will and heart to that which is preſented as lovely and convenient for us?</hi> It is ſuch a conſent, I ſay, of the heart to ſome fair and inviting object, that we conſider our ſelves as joyned and united to it: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that we do not look on our ſelves and it as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining any longer two things which ſubſiſt aſunder; but we conceive a <hi>Whole,</hi> whereof we think our ſelves but one part, and the thing beloved to be the other. Is it not neceſſary then, that we have a mind to cleave to this, and eternally live in dear imbraces of it? Can we endure the thought of being torn from this, and ſo diſſolve the <hi>Whole</hi> which Love hath made? Do not we
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101895:44"/>naturally deſire to conſerve things, eſpecially thoſe of our our own creating? It is unavoidable then, that in any conteſt which may ariſe between theſe parts, we yield to the will of that we love, for fear of a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; unleſs that thing be worſe than our ſelves, and ſo we hope to gain by the diſſolution. If one of theſe two muſt be diſpleaſed, we ſhall ever chuſe that it be our ſelves, unleſs we eſteem the other to be of leſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and worth than our ſelves. There is but that one Exception lyes againſt this general Truth, which I ſhall not ſtick to reiterate, that Love doth ſo tye us to that we love, that we and it become but one whole conſiſting of two parts; and that we ſhall ſooner ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that part which we make, to be croſſed in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, than the other to which we have joyned our ſelves to be diſguſted. Do you doubt of it? Obſerve then, that <hi>Love</hi> being placed on things that differ in <hi>three</hi> degrees, it comes to be divided into <hi>three</hi> ſorts. Either it is to things below us, and then it is called a bare <hi>Affection;</hi> or to things equal to us, and then it is termed <hi>Friendſhip;</hi> or to things above us, and then it arrives at the name of <hi>Devotion.</hi> Thus I have learnt from a wiſe man of my acquaintance. Now the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Love</hi> in every one of theſe being ſuch, that it joyns our hearts to the thing beloved, and we and it make but one whole: in this only they differ, that though we may conſent to part, and break with that which we eſteem leſs than our ſelves, yet we can never agree to be ſeparated from that which we eſteem greater. The leſs part will alwayes be abandoned to the conſervation of the greateſt; we muſt alwayes ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice that which is worſt, to keep intire the beſt. And therefore, though in bare <hi>Affection</hi> a man alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers himſelf before that he loves, when one muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101895:45"/>a diſpleaſure; yet it is quite otherwiſe in the higheſt Love (and ſometime in the ſecond ſort) which we call <hi>Devotion,</hi> for there a man prefers the thing he loves ſo much before himſelf, that he fears not to venture his very life for the conſervation of it. He will ſooner ſever Soul and Body, than conſent that this and his Soul ſhould be divided. He will rather quit all the world, and never ſee it more, than forſake this, and be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from it. Becauſe, as there is no compare, he thinks, between all the world and this, ſo he is tyed with an incomparably ſtronger bond to it, than to all the world. Now of this ſort is the <hi>Love</hi> that we call <hi>Charity,</hi> which is an high Devotion to our <hi>Lord.</hi> Who ſince he is <hi>Lord</hi> of all, the <hi>Lord</hi> of life and glory, the Author of eternal Salvation, the only begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth; if it were poſſible for us to leave ſome things that are better than our ſelves, in expectation of ſomething better than them, to which we will give that Love which they have loſt; yet he will make us love him eternally above all, and live in inſeparable union with him, becauſe there is nothing elſe ſuperiour to him on which to beſtow our Love if we take it from him. If we once ſincerely love him, if we become one with him, it is manifeſtly in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this ſublime affection, to make us part with our ſelves for his ſake: to reſign up all our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires that his will may be done: to loſe whatſoever we call ours, that we may keep him and his good eſteem of us. It is not poſſible that we ſhould grant our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to have that knot untied, which makes us part of ſuch a <hi>whole</hi> whereof the Son of God is the other part. There needs nothing to keep it faſt, but to keep us in our wits. And therefore ſince a will diſtinct from his will, makes us <hi>two</hi> again, we ſhall alwayes
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:101895:45"/>comprimiſe with his will, that we may continue one.</p>
               <p>I believe now you think you ſhall make a mighty purchaſe, if you can but procure this Companion to go along with you. It is apparent to you, that this <hi>Charity</hi> will help and inable you to do all that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you, though it be never ſo much, and hard to be otherwiſe effected. And do you not think that it will make all things eaſie alſo to be done? Alas! it knows no difference between doing and ſuffering but only this, that it chuſes the latter many times as a noble teſtimony to its ſincerity and truth. Nothing will ſeem abſurd, nothing will be thought miſ-becoming, nothing will appear difficult when once you are. in <hi>Love.</hi> It is well compared to an Artificial Glaſs, which when we look thorow, an enemy ſeems a friend, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace is rendred an honour, and hardſhips look like a pleaſure. The <hi>Love</hi> of Chriſt, you know, cauſed him to make himſelf of no reputation. It preſerved his Majeſty, and made it ſeem no diſparagement to be ſo low as a ſervant, and to court his Vaſſals. It hath this priviledge, that it cannot be defamed. And it hath this generoſity, that it cannot learn to deny. Aſk any thing of it, and it will make no difficulty to give it. Nay, aſk a Coat, and it will give the Cloak alſo. Aſk it to go a mile with you, and it will go two. Aſk it to forgive one injury, and it will forgive an hundred. Aſk it to render you a ſervice, and it will ſerve you with its whole ſelf. So that I think one of the ancient Guides of the Church had reaſon, who ſaid, <hi>Love, and do what thou wilt.</hi> Take thine own courſe, ſo that thou doſt but heartily <hi>Love.</hi> This is a thing ſo powerful, that it withſtands our temperament, and reſiſts our
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:101895:46"/>moſt natural inclinations. It claps a new Biaſs upon our hearts; it carries us againſt the ſtream and tide of ſenſitive deſires; it breaks the chains of cuſtom; it roots up inveterate habits; it is of ſuch vaſt force that it makes us vanquiſh our ſelves, and obliges us to deſtroy our own pleaſures that we may pleaſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is ſtrangely bountiful and liberal with all, thinking it can never do enough to make it ſelf known to thoſe whom it loves. From whence it is, that whereas they who live only in a fear and dread of God have ſtarv'd and half dead affections to him, which makes them do but little, and that with a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs and ſadneſs, as if they deſired to be excuſed: They whoſe hearts burn with Love to him have all their powers excited thereby to do their beſt for him; and they ſtrain themſelves with the greateſt gladneſs to execute his pleaſure in all things. And to ſay the truth, there is no paſſion of the ſoul, but Love hath it at its full command. They all owe their Original to Love, and would have no being at all if it were not in the ſoul before them. If there were no Love im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted by God in our natures, there would be no deſire, no hatred; no grief, no joy; no fear, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; for all theſe grow upon this ſingle root, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are but Love ſhooting forth in divers ſhapes. They are I ſay but ſeveral motions which Love cauſes; the different figures which it aſſumes according as the object and occaſion requires. It is Love which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires when the thing is abſent, which hates that which would ſpoil its injoyments; which grieves for the loſs or fears the departure, which deſpairs of the coming or joyes in the preſence of a beloved good. What therefore ſhould that be, which Love cannot do; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it carries all theſe along with it, and leads the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:101895:46"/>whole ſoul thither, whither it goes it ſelf? It is an active and buſie affection; having as much Vivacity as it hath ſtrength. Its life conſiſts in motion; and like to the Heart it ceaſes to live when it ceaſes to ſtir. It is painted you know with wings and will make you fly rather then go to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> It is like to Fire which is both a greedy and a fierce Element. A very covetous affection I mean, that thinks it never hath enough of that which it deſires; and ſo earneſt and vehement that it never reſts till it hath ſpent it ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its beloved. It is like the holy fire which God ſent from Heaven, which was found unextinguiſhed at the return from <hi>Babylon</hi> (as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſay) in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a Well, all covered with mudd and dirt. Much water from without cannot quench it; and the dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and heavineſs of our own temper cannot repreſs it. But as fire elevates the matter to which it takes though it be never ſo groſs and ponderous: So doth Love raiſe the hearts wherein it makes an impreſſion, and ſtirs them up to actions far ſurmounting their Age, their breeding and condition. There is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain chearfulneſs alſo in this affection, like to the ſhining and brightneſs of Fire, which contributes much to the augmenting of its activity. It diffuſeth a ſecret joy through the whole ſoul which cannot be diſſembled; but caſts a ſplendor into the countenance of thoſe in whom it reſides. Though Melancholy indeed is ſometimes the companion of other Love, yet it cannot find ſo eaſie acceſs to Divine Charity: For that which the one wants, the other hath, and that which the one doubts of, the other neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. Is not this the common cauſe of ſuch ſadneſs, that Love meets with no return from an heart to which it hath given its own, or is in deſpair of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:101895:47"/>all the obſtacles of its ſatisfaction? But theſe are things that cannot find a place in this heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born affection, which is nothing elſe but a return of our Love to God who hath loved us firſt, and thereby given us aſſurance that he is deſirous to be injoyed by us. All the heavineſs then of pious ſouls is when they cannot make ſuch returns as they wiſh, not when they feel this flame within them; for then they are ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed and raviſhed with joy, both becauſe it is an effect of the Love of God to them, and becauſe hereby they do actually injoy him. Now as Melancholy and ſadneſs do oppreſs the ſpirits and make us lazy and unwilling to ſtir; ſo this chearfulneſs and lightſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind which Love infuſes do ſet them free, and render us active and vigorous in our motion. Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly is a Lethargick humour and binds up all the powers, becauſe its frozen diſpoſition imagines all things impoſſible to be either done or avoided: but chearfulneſs by its heat and warmth gives us ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of confidence that things are not ſo hard to be undertaken; and it thaws, melts and looſens our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties into freedom and liberty, whereby we become of a lively forward and ready diſpoſition. Love there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being of this pleaſant and chearful nature, you ſee muſt needs both quicken your ſpirit and facilitate your work. Nay it is apt to excite and inſpire others who come near us, and therefore much more our ſelves. Chearfulneſs and the love from whence it ſprings makes our countenance ſmooth and clear, and invites others into our Society. When this paſſion ſtirs in the heart, the face is all over touched with the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it; which both intices and inlivens thoſe that approach us. How is it poſſible then that we ſhould not feel theſe effects of it our ſelves, that are ſo ſenſible
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:101895:47"/>to others? or what heart is there ſo cold and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, that would not be poſſeſſed with this affection which is as uſeful as delightful; and whoſe benefits redound to our neighbours and ſtay not in our ſelves? It will not let us be a terrour to our own ſouls, nor appear with ſuch a diſmal aſpect that we ſhould ſcare and affright others. It will not drive others from Piety while it carries us unto it. It will not ſuffer us to put Religion on the rack that we may look ſevere. And it is far from making us appear ſo, as though we imagined we could not be ſaved, unleſs we make an ugly face.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay more? need I tell you that <hi>Love</hi> is full of imitation and forces us to conform our ſelves to the humour and diſpoſition of him whom we Love? There is a ſtranger property by far then this which will make you open your heart to it; and that is a ſingular <hi>Sagacity</hi> which it is Maſter of, whereby it knows what is fit to be done without any teaching. If you were fully in the power of it, it would go near to render me of no uſe, being it ſelf inſtead of twenty Maſters. It knows what will pleaſe before it be told and ſees what is acceptable without a director. It hath eyes of its own to find out its way, and by its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate wiſdome would lead you ſtreight to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> It is very skilfull to ſpy out its duty, and hath a quick perception of what is befitting in every paſſage of life. In ſo much that when a man begins to Love, he begins to know how to guide himſelf. His Love will ſuggeſt unto him many things which he ought to do; and be inſtead of a thouſand Monitors to put him upon the doing of them. It will make a man deſcry the leaſt faults in himſelf, though it hide them in others. It
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:101895:48"/>notes an undecency with as much ſeverity, as another marks a groſs impurity. It labours to overcome the ſmalleſt infirmity, and weeps more for a mote in its eye, then others do for a beam. Nay it is afflicted for thoſe things which no body ſees, ſave only it ſelf. It bluſhes more for a vain thought, then the reſt of the world do for a monſtrous act. It hath a curioſity about thoſe little circumſtances, which all men are wont to overſee or neglect. Its niceneſs and delicacy is ſo great, that it abhors the very ſhadow of all evil. And it every way ſtrives to adorn it ſelf with ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy; that there may not be the leaſt ſpeck to render it leſs fair and beautiful in the eyes of God.</p>
               <p>Love therefore I beſeech you, Love as much as ever you are able, if you mean to be happy. Make your heart ready as an Altar, for this Fire from above to deſcend upon it. Prepare your ſelf as a Sacrifice to be offered up in this Holy flame to the Lord of Love. Let all the world know that you are a conſecrated thing: tell it that you cannot entertain its ſute, nor unhallow the place where heaven is pleaſed to dwell. Yield your ſelf a captive to this mighty Conquerour, whereby you will be inabled to conquer all things elſe. Subject your ſelf to the power of that, which will bring the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh under your feet. Let it take away your liberty of doing what you pleaſe, that it may make you free to do as you ought. Poſſeſs it of your ſoul intirely and ſuffer it to inſpire all your deſires and to order all your motions; and it will not fail to poſſeſs you of that bleſſed place to which you wiſh to be conducted. And is this any difficult thing that I require of you? I ſhould rather think that we are highly obliged to God for making
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:101895:48"/>the way to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſo eaſie and our arriving there ſo certain as it is. For <hi>Love</hi> is the moſt natural and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant thing in the world which will certainly bring us thither, and God being ſo lovely and having loved us ſo much, one would think it ſhould be an eaſie thing to beget it in our hearts. Do you not mark how a Dog loves you, if you do but throw him a bone or ſome ſuch thing, which to you is of no uſe or worth at all? For this he fawns upon you; for this he ſtayes in your houſe, and keeps your door, and defends your goods; this makes him follow you at the heels if you pleaſe, to travel with you long journies, to forſake all other Maſters for your ſervice, and many times to dye with you: though it be a poor thing, which you know not what to do withall, unleſs you caſt it unto him. How can you chuſe then but love Jeſus, and be at his command, and follow his ſteps, and leave all others for his ſake, and even give your life to him; who hath given you not a thing of no value, not that which coſt him nothing, or that which he could not tell what to do withall, but himſelf, his holy blood, his pretious promiſes which it coſt an infinite deal of pain to ſeal and ratifie unto you. Are you ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of his favours when you think of this? Are you ſtill to learn to Love when ſuch a weight of Love as this doth preſs your heart? If ſuch a thought could enter my mind, I would ſend you to the brutes to be their Scholler, I would call your Spaniel and bid him teach you; I would ceaſe to be your inſtructer any longer, and put you there to learn the affection you owe to your deareſt Lord and Maſter. But your bluſhes bid me ſpare this language and ſeem to aſſure me both that you are aſhamed to owe your vertue to ſuch examples, and that you feel already this flame
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:101895:49"/>inkindled in your heart. Feed it I beſeech you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually and let it increaſe unto greater ardors of Love as it will infallibly, if you do but conſider what great things your Saviour hath done for you, and that he is ſtill buſie in procuring your good; and in ſhort, that there is not an hour, not a moment wherein you do not ſtand indebted to him for eternal bleſſings, or for the means of them, or for the grace to help you to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them.</p>
               <p>And indeed the poor Pilgrims heart did beat at ſuch a rate, that it ſeemed to knock againſt his ribs. He was ſet all on fire with theſe words; and at laſt found means to vent himſelf and burſt out in ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as theſe. O Sir, what have you done! I feel the Love of Jeſus burn ſo vehemently in my breaſt, that I ſhall be devoured by it, if it laſt a moment lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in this force. I have ſcarce any breath left to tell you, that you have made me love your ſelf alſo with a violent paſſion. I have no power no more then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, to reſiſt this Almighty Lover of Souls. I render my ſelf his priſoner and wiſh to be eternally held in his chains. You have linkt me to your ſelf too ſo faſt, that I am at once become his ſlave, and your ſervant. I would go to the worlds end to ſeek theſe two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Charity;</hi> if they were not alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy become my gueſts by your means. You have given me a greater treaſure then I thought to find in thoſe few words which I received from you; and methinks I feel already that <hi>I am nought, and I have nought, and I deſire nought but Jeſus and Jeruſalem.</hi> If it be not abſurd to ſpeak in ſuch terms, I am in love with this <hi>Love</hi> which you have deſcribed. I ſee methinks <hi>Humility</hi> and all things elſe in its armes. I embrace
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:101895:49"/>them both with all my ſoul. I welcome them with my beſt affections into my heart. And if I had more hearts then one, I would offer them all to the Humble Love of my ſweeteſt Saviour. Go on Sir, as long as you pleaſe; if you have not taught me all my leſſon in teaching me to Love. You have tyed my ears to your tongue and they cannot but liſten to your ſpeech. Nor ſhall I ever feel any wearineſs in hearing of you; for you have made me in Love with your diſcourſe, by breathing the Love of my Lord into my heart.</p>
               <p>Here he making a little reſt, the Guide had leave to reſume his office: though he was ſo fill'd with joy to ſee the good effects of what he had ſaid, that it was not eaſie on a ſudden to find room for any other thoughts. The deſire alſo that he felt of ſpeaking ſomething extraordinary on this occaſion, had like to have impoſed ſilence on him, and denyed a paſſage to his words. But his Prudence telling him how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it was to keep himſelf now from ſuch tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, he ſoon reduced himſelf to his uſual temper and thus began to renew his diſcourſe. It is no wonder to find that <hi>Jeſus</hi> captivates hearts; and that the Love of a dying Saviour is ſo powerful as to inthral them to his ſervice. All that ſurpriſes me is no more then this, that ſuch feeble words as mine ſhould ſo ſenſibly touch your inclinations to him, and with ſuch ſpeed excite ſo high a degree of Love in your heart. It gives me great incouragement to continue my inſtructions, and affords no leſs incouragement to your ſelf to continue your attention; For if you are already under the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Love by what hath been now delivered, I ſhall make you love unmeaſurably before I have finiſhed this diſcourſe. You have ſeen but half of the riches of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:101895:50"/>that golden ſentence, and there are greater ſecrets ſtill behind in thoſe two pretious words which are at the concluſion of it. For I pray you ſatisfie me in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; Have you well conſidered what <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is, to which you now direct your face? I will not ſtay for your anſwer, but proceed to tell you that I am now going to give you ſuch an <hi>Idaea</hi> of it, that if you keep it freſh in your mind, you cannot imagine how it will ſnatch you from the world and heighten your love unto your Saviour, and lift you quite out of your own will, if you had a mind to fall into it back again. And truly I cannot think that you ſhould have any great liſt to travel long, or that you ſhould not ſoon feel a wearineſs to invade your members; if you go you know not whither, and carry not along with you a true information of the happy repoſe, you are like to meet withall at your journies end. Let <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> then be the ſubject of our next diſcourſe, and ſuffer your eyes to be drawn to that bleſſed place, which I believe you have often heard commended, as the <hi>Perfection of Beauty and the Joy of the whole earth.</hi>

               <head type="sub">A Deſcription of the City <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> and of the happineſs be ſhould there meet withall.</head>
               <p>I Have no faculty (it muſt be confeſſed) of making good deſcriptions of thoſe places which I have <hi>ſeen;</hi> and therefore it muſt not be expected that I paint you exactly a place which I know but by <hi>report.</hi> It is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that I tell you nothing but the truth, and do not imitate them who fill their Maps with <hi>Chimaera's</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:101895:50"/>of their own brain; though I do not compleatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineate every part of it, but leave many ſpaces void to be filled up by your ſelf when you ſhall have the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to arrive there. Know then, that as to the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of this City, it is agreed by all to be incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably ſweet, beyond the faireſt place that this world of ours doth afford. For it is ſeated on a very high mountain, loftier then <hi>Olympus</hi> it ſelf; which yet is ſaid to lift its head above the clouds, and to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to none of our ſtorms and tempeſts; and to be deprived of the Sun beams by nothing elſe, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the night it ſelf. It is advanced I ſay far above the higheſt part of this heavy earth and foggy air, aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into the purer ſky; where the Sun never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws its rayes, and where there is not the leaſt ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of miſt or vapour, either to obſcure its light, or to offend the moſt delicate ſenſe that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. There are nothing but pure and fragrant odors which perfume that happy climate; there is a perpetual calm and quiet which reigns in that noble region; there is no noiſe but that which infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and charms the ſoul into ſtill and quiet medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But that which is of greateſt remark and moſt to be remembred is, the glorious Proſpect which a place of this advantage yields. All the world here preſents it ſelf before ones eyes; and makes them the center in which, the beauty and glory of it conſpires to meet. I would not have you think I mean a world ſo ſmall as that, which we inhabit upon this Globe of Earth; but one which comprehends the Sun and Moon and all the other adjoyning orbs which are there beheld to move in comely meaſures about that Prince of lights. Thoſe balls of Fire alſo which you ſee fixed in the firmament ſo remote from you, will fall into
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:101895:51"/>your better view: who though they ſeem here but like blinking candles and ſickly flames; will there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear moſt noble lights, deſigned for ſome greater end, then to lend us a feeble comfort in the night. It will be infinitely contenting to ſee the beauty and fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of every part of this vaſt frame; the fitneſs, uſefulneſs and correſpondence of it to all the reſt of its neighbouring parts; together with the exact and admirable order of the Whole. And can you imagine into what tranſports it will caſt your ſoul to hear the praiſes of the Creator ſung by all his Works of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? And yet that is another priviledge of this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed place, by the advantage of whoſe holy ſilence, you will receive the chearful hymns wherewith every creature you behold, doth celebrate the wiſdom, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and goodneſs of him that made it. You have heard (no doubt) of the Muſick of the Sphaeres, which they ſay would raviſh ſouls from theſe mortal bodies, ſhould it but ſtrongly touch their ears; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is almoſt drown'd by the noiſe and clatter of this lower world. This is it which I am now commending to you, that ſweet concent which all creatures make among themſelves, that rare harmony which there is in the motion of all the heavenly Orbs; which ſtrikes the mind ſo agreeably, that one cannot chuſe but dance for joy together with them. But it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per entertainment of thoſe who dwell in that ſtill Region, in which alone it can be diſtinctly heard; and where an everlaſting ſong to the Creator of all doth melt their hearts to joyn in conſort with that Univerſal harmony.</p>
               <p>But yet the place is nothing ſo conſiderable as the Perſons that inhabit it; nor will it be ſo uſeful to draw
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:101895:51"/>their pictures curiouſly as to deſcribe their life and manners. Enquire not therefore of the vaſtneſs of this place, the ſtatelineſs of its buildings, the riches of their furniture, and ſuch like things; but know that it is the City of the <hi>Great King:</hi> the ſeat of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Majeſty of Heaven and Earth: the place where the Lord and Governour of the whole world, whoſe Dominion is an everlaſting Dominion, and who reigns through all Generations, keeps his Court. Do you not think it will be a pleaſingly amazing ſight to behold the Majeſty of his Glory? Or, What greater happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can you wiſh, if you were to be the diſpoſer of your own fortune, than alway to ſtand before the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign of the World, as one of his Miniſters and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants; and to live in his bleſſed preſence, as one whom he highly favours? To behold the wiſdom of his Government, the righteouſneſs and goodneſs of his Laws, the admirable contrivance of all his Works, the univerſal care which he takes of all his Creatures, the infinite extent of his Providence, and the power of his Authority, whereby he doth whatſoever he pleaſes in Heaven and Earth, and Sea, and all deep places. To ſee how he brings thoſe things together which were removed far aſunder; and diſſolves the combinations and confederacies of thoſe things which were cloſely united. To contemplate how he hereby makes thoſe deſigns abortive, which were juſt bringing forth, how he diſappoints the deviſes of the crafty, and confounds all the ſubtilty of the world, and catches it in its own ſnares. It will ſtrangely tranſport you to ſee the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Holineſs, the ſplendor and brightneſs of his Underſtanding, the largeneſs of his Love, his uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Juſtice, his unexhauſted Goodneſs, his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable Truth, his uncontroulable Power, his vaſt
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:101895:52"/>Dominions, which yet he fills with his preſence, and adminiſters their affairs with eaſe, and is magnified and praiſed in them by the throng of all his creatures. Theſe things I will leave to your own private thoughts, that I may have time to ſpeak of the reſt of the caeleſtial Inhabitants, but eſpecially of the <hi>Kings Son,</hi> who is a principal ornament (if I may ſpeak in ſo low a phraſe) and a great glory to this place. And of him I ſhall need to tell you no more than this, that in his perſon there is to be ſeen at once the moſt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious <hi>Lover</hi> and <hi>Warriour</hi> that ever was. His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts have been innumerable. His Victories no Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory but one of his own inſpiring is able to recount. He hath trodden down the moſt potent and giantly enemies. He hath triumphed over the Powers of Earth and Air. He hath trailed the greateſt Tyrant that ever was ſeen at his Chariot-wheels. And there is one univerſal triumph of his over all things ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, wherein there will be ſpecial marks of honour ſet on all the Citizens of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who are to bear a part in it; which will aſtoniſh and raviſh all their hearts with Admiration, Love and Joy. This will be the moſt ſplendid ſhew, the moſt illuſtrious appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that ever the Sun ſaw; for all Angels, and all Men; all that ever have been, are, or ſhall be, will there be ſummoned to attend in ſome ſort or other upon the Pomp of that great day. Then all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> will be ſeen with Crowns of Gold on their heads which this great Prince will beſtow upon them; then they will appear on the Theatre of the world as ſo many Kings raigning together with him; and then all the Heavens will ring with ſhouts of joy and praiſe to him that redeemed them, as they march along in his train thorow the Air to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:101895:52"/>For, as I told you, he is the moſt glorious <hi>Lover</hi> that ever was: and the greatneſs of his valour and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, doth not at all extinguiſh his nobler flames. He is owner of the moſt tender heart that ever was in any breaſt; and hath rendred himſelf redoubtable to his greateſt enemies by nothing more than this, that he hath won ſo many hearts, and triumphed over ſo many brave ſouls, who were vanquiſhed by nothing elſe but the power of his mighty Love. Such a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Lover he was, that though he was rich, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came poor, that they on whom he had ſet his heart might be made rich. He laid aſide the Robes of his Glory, that they might be inveſted with them. He took upon him the ſhape of a ſervant, that he might prefer them to be the Sons of God, and Heirs of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And at laſt he voluntarily, and without any compulſion but that of his Love, dyed upon a Croſs to ſave the lives of thoſe who were ſo far from having any reſentments of Love to him, that they had the hearts of moſt deſperate enemies againſt him. For you muſt know, that he is ſuch a <hi>Lord of Love,</hi> that the hatred and malignity of men could not extinguiſh the fervours of his paſſion. All the diſcourteſies they could do him, were not able to prevail with him to lay aſide his thoughts of kindneſs toward them. The innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable affronts which he received could not make him go back to Heaven, and forſake this ill-natur'd world; till he had expreſſed all the Love conceiveable unto it. No, he dyed for thoſe who took away his life. His bowels earned toward thoſe who were ready to rake into them with their bloody hands. His heart burnt with affection to thoſe wretches, that cruelly pierced it, and thruſt it thorow with a ſpear. And therefore I cannot but think you would have
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101895:53"/>a mind to take a journey to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and judge your pains and travel well beſtowed, if it were for nothing elſe but to ſee this Illuſtrious Perſon; eſpecially to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him in all his glory, and his higheſt exaltation, who is the <hi>Patron</hi> of all good ſouls, the great Protector of all Pilgrims, the Guide and Reſt too of all noble Travellers; and who bears a particular affection to your ſelf, who hath ſuffered ſo much for you; who hath ſent you ſo many meſſages of his Love, who hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared himſelf to you by a thouſand favours, and was never contented till he brought you to himſelf, that you might be there where he is, and behold the glory which his Father hath given to him. There he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to entertain all pious men with an everlaſting Supper, to make them a never-ceaſing Jubilee; and treat them with ſuch ſumptuous magnificence, that there will not be tongues enough among them all to publiſh his praiſes, and their own thankfulneſs. Only you muſt remember that the entertainment he will give them, is himſelf, and that they will feaſt eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon his bleſſed face. Their happineſs will be to ſee God, to behold the glory which is given to our Lord; that is to know him, and to be filled with his Wiſdom, Love and Likeneſs.</p>
               <p>And here, leſt I ſhould not be underſtood, and you ſhould imagine the happineſs of ſeeing God and his Son to be leſs than it is, let me ſtop a while to explain this part of my deſcription to you, before I paſs unto the reſt. You muſt not then conceive that the pleaſure of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is to ſit whole Ages, and meerly to gaze upon the Divinity; or that they who enjoy the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of that happy place, do nothing elſe but feed their eyes with the beauties of our Saviours face: No, theſe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:101895:53"/>are the fancies of low and uninſtructed minds, who know no higher enjoyments than thoſe of ſenſe. To ſee God, will be to have ſuch a knowledge of him as gives our hearts a powerful touch, and ſtrikes them with ſuch a lively ſenſe of him, that he turns them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly into his nature, and transforms them into the likeneſs of his divine excellencies. This glorious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject doth, as I may ſo ſpeak, diffuſe and ſpread it ſelf all over inamour'd ſouls, and by a living heat doth animate them into the ſame diſpoſition with it ſelf. The beauty on which they fix their eyes, doth imprint its own form upon their hearts, and makes them fair and beautiful with the ſame lovely qualities which they delight to behold. They do not buſie themſelves there, as men imagine, in gaping upon the ſplendor and the many ornaments of that place, but they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves become a part of its glory, and are changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that on which they faſten their eyes. They do not ſpend their time only in looking upon God, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly prying into him; but they receive him into their hearts, and he enters into their ſouls. He doth not guild them with his beams, but they themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Light</hi> in the Lord. There is not a glory only caſt about them, but they receive ſuch rayes of light from his face, as dart into their very hearts, and ſhine thorow their whole ſouls, ſo that they alſo become lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous and bright. They are ſo raviſhed with his Goodneſs, that they are made Good. They are ſo affected with his Wiſdom, that they become Wiſe. The ſenſe they have of his incomparable Purity, renders them more Holy; and his dear Love ſo over-maſters their ſouls, that they conform in all things to his hearts deſire, and it ſeems as if both their hearts had but one and the ſame motion. In ſhort, my meaning is, that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:101895:54"/>they are not happy at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by any external in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God (which is all the vulgar conceit doth reach, when we ſpeak of ſeeing his glory) but they are inwardly moved by a powerful efflux from him, which quickens them into the ſame thoughts, will and deſire with himſelf. Their ſouls are not outwardly painted with him, and ſome colours, as it were, of his Wiſdom living Images of God, and really changed into a true reſemblance of that which they behold. It is not ſome glory that appears before them which makes them bleſſed; but they are made all glorious within, and become themſelves God-like creatures. They do not behold the Divinity only without themſelves; but they ſee God within them, and looking into their own ſouls, there they find him, and are happy in him. And let me add this by the way, as I paſs to other things, that ſuch a knowledge and participation of God you muſt purſue in this world, if you mean to come to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> You muſt here be partakers of a <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and now be <hi>transformed by the renewing of your mind, proving what is that good, and perfect, and acceptable will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I think it is time to lead you to other Spectacles which are worthy your ſight, and to tell you that in this City, all the glorious Miniſters of State to the <hi>King of Kings,</hi> have their Manſion-houſes, and Noble Palaces. All the <hi>Heroes</hi> of ancient daies do here make their abode. Nay all the ſpirits of juſt men that are made perfect, do here inhabit and have their conſtant reſidence. And all thoſe glittering Angels, and thoſe brave minds that ever flouriſh in this heavenly Court, I believe you will think ſufficient of themſelues, if
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:101895:54"/>there were nothing elſe to render this a very ſplendid place. The Laws indeed of which are ſuch, that none can be permitted to live there but Noble men, perſons of high birth, and illuſtrious deſcent; for they are all called the <hi>Sons of God.</hi> But that which gives them this Nobility, and ſtamps ſuch an honourable title upon them, is not ſuch poor things as ſwell the men of our world into an aiery and imaginary greatneſs; but the height of their minds, the purity of their hearts, and the excellent qualities wherewith they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, which intitle them to the kindred of God. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the meaneſt Pilgrim on the earth that is found worthy by reaſon of his virtuous diſpoſition, and generous ſpirit, to be admitted a Citizen of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> inſtantly becomes Noble, and is inrolled among the Princes of heavenly Progeny. Into this bleſſed ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety then when once you are received, How delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful do you think their company and acquaintance will prove? Are you not highly pleaſed now with a rare Hiſtory, and could you not lend your ears for a whole day to hear the adventures of ſome one famous perſon? And yet theſe are nothing to the pleaſures that they can entertain you withall. There were never ſuch things yet reported, as the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> will be ready to impart and communicate with you: Who can tell you a long ſtory of the Love of God, and make a never-ceaſing relation, an endleſs hiſtory of all the rare paſſages of his providence throughout the whole world. They can preſent you with a thouſand <hi>Abrahams,</hi> and as many <hi>Joſephs,</hi> whoſe adventures were ſo ſtrange, that fiction is not able to invent any thing ſo ſurpriſing. Nay out of thoſe Countries where you thought there was nothing but horrid deſerts, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage ſouls, and barbarous cuſtoms; they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:101895:55"/>you many worthy minds, whoſe renowned acts it will give you an infinite joy to have rehearſed.</p>
               <p>But there is nothing, I believe, will touch you with a greater inclination to their converſe, than the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſingular love and friendſhip that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all the Inhabitants of that City: provided you be already touched with any ſenſe of the pleaſure of that noble paſſion. They are a people, I told you, of the moſt excellent nature, and the ſweeteſt diſpoſition in the world. They are void of all deceit and guile; of all hatred and envy, of all covetouſneſs and ſelf-love, of all anger and peeviſhneſs, with whatſoever other things there are that diſturb our peace, and ſpoil our converſe here below: So that they make the moſt agreeable ſociety that ever was, and interchange to each others ſuch pleaſures as my tongue hath not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions powerful enough to paint them forth. There is no ſtrangeneſs at all among them. You can meet no body there, but they will entertain you with as much kindneſs and ſincerity, as if they had known you many years. And when many come together in one place, there is no danger of their jarring, by reaſon of their different ſentiments; but they bring a great addition of pleaſure, and make the moſt delicious har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that ever moved the heart of man. There they entwine in the deareſt embraces. There they open to each other their very hearts. There they ſtudy to increaſe, not to diminiſh their mutual happineſs. There they think all that another injoyes, is as if they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it themſelves. And what they have of their own, it is not for themſelves alone, but for every body elſe. There you ſhall meet with no pale fears, no anxious cares, no fruitleſs wiſhes, no tormenting jealouſies, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:101895:55"/>no amorous ſighs neither; for every one will love others as much as they deſire, and wiſh for no return again, but only Love. If there be any particular Friendſhips there; they do not at all ſpoil the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal kindneſs of the place. Others will not be loved the worſe for them, but rather loved better; becauſe they will teach thoſe united hearts the greateſt Love. They may be eſteemed alſo one of the beauteous ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles of the place, and be reckoned among the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful varieties which will entertain us: When after the pleaſures of a more general and large converſation, every one may retire to the company of thoſe he loveth moſt.</p>
               <p>There you will be met with ſuch great and ſhining lights as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſet all the world on fire with the flames of their love. You will fall into the company of thoſe burning hearts who were martyr'd firſt by their own Love, and then by their Perſecutors fury for the good of the world. And do you think they have put off their affections when they laid aſide their rags of fleſh? Did all their fire go out, when they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a diſſolution of their houſe of earth? Or ſhall we imagine that this generous paſſion is the off-ſpring of our body, and ows its being, birth and ſtrength to this corporeal nature? We may not ſo defame and aſperſe the Love of our Lord; who no doubt hath a more tender heart in the heavens, then he had upon the earth. We may expect to find there more Love in the breaſts of theſe holy Lovers who followed him, then here they were owners of; though they had then ſo much that it was large enough to embrace the whole world. They have not left their nature, but only its imperfections. They have not changed their
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:101895:56"/>affections, but only heightned and improv'd them. And therefore judge how happy you will be in the acquaintance of ſuch perſons, and how much more happy in their excellent friendſhip. Your Love will be raiſed to a ſtrange pitch, when you approach ſuch intenſe and vaſtly increaſed flames. Your heart will be all Fire when you come near to ſuch huge furnaces; the heat of whoſe Love in this cold region was ſo ſtrong, that it would have forced a ſenſible ſoul to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire with them. And is the joy think you conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able which you will feel, when you find your ſelf in the arms of thoſe mighty Lovers? For my part I can imagine nothing but an Ecſtaſie, when we ſhall be placed in ſuch great Hearts; which are nothing elſe but Love and Joy to ſee us at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> I cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to my deſires a pleaſure more charming then this, unleſs it be to joyn both heart and voice with the whole number of thoſe glorious friends, to chaunt the praiſes of our Creator and Redeemer. And indeed it is beyond the meaſure of my poor ſkill to invent any words that can tolerably deſcribe the Melodies which will then be made, when the glorious company of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the goodly fellowſhip of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Army of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> the glittering Troops of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, and the innumerable Hoſts of triumphant Souls, ſhall compoſe but one Quire to ſing their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems and Hallelujahs to the God of Love. But yet I am apt to think that their Muſick will receive no ſmall part of its graces from hence, that there will be no diſcord in their hearts nor jarring in their affections, but that Love will exactly tune them to a perfect har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. Nay, this ſeems to be the ſum of what we can ſay of the happineſs of that eſtate, that it conſiſts in a <hi>rapturous Love of God, and a moſt paſſionate Love of one
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:101895:56"/>another.</hi> And truly this is a thing ſo inviting, and I have ſuch a particular affection to this <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Spirit</hi> among Brethren, that I ſhould be tempted here to ſpeak a little of that <hi>Charity</hi> which you ought to have to your neighbour (as I have already inſtructed you about that you owe to God) but that I have aſſigned another time and place for that diſcourſe.</p>

You would ſay the moſt pleaſant dayes that here we lead and ſtudy to prolong to an hundred years, are but like a ſleep and a dream, a meer image and ſhaddow of life; if you could but be raiſed for one minute to the ſtrength and activity of thoſe happy people, and receive but the ſleighteſt taſte of thoſe lively and eſſential delights which force the whole ſoul to attend unto them. The briſkneſs and chearfulneſs of our youthful time, doth not ſo much excell the flat and inſipid pleaſures of our decrepit Age; as they themſelves are ſurpaſſed by the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:101895:57"/>and height of thoſe joyes wherein the Citizens of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> are eternally immerſed. It is impoſſible for me to declare the ſmalleſt part of the ſweet delectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they reſent; but, to gratifie thoſe longings which I diſcern I have already excited in you, I ſhall run the adventure of deſcribing a few of thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that guſh out of that full and ever-ſpringing foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Good with whom they live and maintain an happy converſe. And becauſe I believe you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to know, how they receive and take in thoſe voluptuous injoyments, I will indeavour with one la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſatisfie you in both.</p>
               <p>You may conceive then if you pleaſe that ſuch a ſpirit as your own being advanced and fortified much beyond the feeble narrowneſs of this preſent ſtate, doth continually imploy the higheſt and moſt Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign powers that it hath, upon the higheſt and moſt ſupream Good. That it is daily admiring his excellent nature, loving and embracing his amiable perfections, bleſſing and praiſing his bounteous diſpoſition, ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to conform it ſelf to all his deſires, rejoycing in the full ſatisfaction which he communicates to its heart, and in one word doing all thoſe actions which a ſoul is capable to perform upon any other object in this world: And then you will have a little <hi>Idea</hi> of that infinite delectation which ſuch a conjunction of the very top and flour of the mind with the beginning and original of all good muſt needs produce. Look how you are moved in the injoyment of any ſenſual good, and that will tell you what they do who live at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and wherein the pleaſure of their life doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. You ſee it or ſome way or other perceive it, you apprehend and lay hold of it; you feel it; you cleave
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:101895:57"/>unto it; you are tickled and delighted in it: and juſt ſo will you and all they live and be happy in God who arrive at that bleſſed place. Their life and felicity conſiſts in a clear and diſtinct perception of him; in a cloſe union and conjunction of heart and will with him; in a feeling of the pleaſures that are in him; in an ardent embracement of him that they may more feel him; and in an high delight and raviſhment of ſpirit in ſuch injoyment of him. Thither if we can but get, we ſhall love as much as we are able, and be able to love far more then we can now think. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the object will intend the affection. The vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Good will force the will to deſire and love more then elſe it would. We ſhall injoy according to the wideneſs of our Capacit; and all our Capacities will be ſo inlarged, that they will exceed the extent of our preſent thoughts, as much as our preſent thoughts exceed our preſent injoyments. It is a life wherein we ſhall do nothing but what we deſire; and wherein all things ſhall be juſt as we will our ſelves; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ſhall will nothing but that which is moſt to be choſen. A life every act of which muſt needs be ſweet, and full of joy, beyond all the meaſures of all our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent wiſhes. When we think, we ſhall rejoyce; when we love, we ſhall rejoyce; when we adore or praiſe, we ſhall rejoyce. Whatſoever we do it will have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite delight and pleaſure in it; and when we have done it never ſo oft it will be eternally to be done again: and we ſhall likewiſe have more power to do it; and every repetition of ſuch acts will be with a freſh addition of contentment in the doing of them. There is no ſatiety nor loathing in the injoyment of that good; no fainting nor growing weary: but we ſhall alwayes think we have enough and yet ſtill be
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:101895:58"/>injoying more; we ſhall be in a perpetual youth and vigor, and yet daily growing more ſtrong and able to converſe with God. For that great Good cannot be known at once, nor can all the ſweetneſs of that life be inſtantly taſted, nor the rivers of thoſe pleaſures be drunk up at one draught: but freſh delights will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually entertain us; new pleaſures will be ſpringing forth unto us, and a flood of joy that we never knew before will over-flow us, out of that full fountain who now iſſues forth in ſo many ſtreams, and diffuſes himſelf in ſuch great varieties in this world; that our minds may be every moment imploy'd in ſome rarity of nature which till then did never affect their eyes. A happy life ſure this will be, when we ſhall have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us ſuch an inexhauſted ocean of Good to fill us, and ſuch great appetites to be filled, and ſuch repeated ſatisfaction in the filling of them, and ſuch an increaſe of ſtrength by their ſatisfaction; and wider capacities alſo created by the continual flowing in of that good upon us, which will diſtend and ſtretch our ſouls by its injoyment, to make us more able to injoy it.</p>
               <p>And now need I be at any pains to perſwade you that this City is a place which abounds ſo much with a plenty of all good things, that there can be no want at all; but a perfect fulneſs of whatſoever may be an happineſs to us? It is apparent already that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we can deſire, there it is preſent, and whatſoever is preſent is Good, and whatſoever good there is, it is all Good, pure good, without any evil; and that pure Good is all in one Good, GOD himſelf, who can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but Good. How much do the Good things of this world delight us, which yet are not Good by themſelves, nor contain in them all that Good is, nor
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101895:58"/>are only Good neither, but come with a great mixture of trouble to us? Will not the injoyment then of him give us infinitely more pleaſure and make us perfectly happy, who is Good by himſelf and not by derivation from any other, and ſo is perfectly Good, and nothing elſe but Good without any thing at all to abate his ſweetneſs. Theſe things here below (ſaith an ancient Guide to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> whom I have met withall) are ſomething Good,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>St.</hi> Aug.</note> elſe how ſhould they at all delight us? but they could not be Good at all, if it were not for him that is All Good and only Good who hath made them to be what Good they are. For all Good was created by him, and he is that Good which was created by none. He is Good by his own Good, and not by any participated Goodneſs; He is Good from his Good ſelf, and not by adhering to any other Good. As much therefore as he excells all other Good, ſo much muſt our injoyment of him excell all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment. As he is a Good that is from none but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo our happineſs will be a Good that depends on none but his happineſs. When we are with him we ſhall but aſk, and we ſhall ſee; we ſhall but ſee, and we ſhall love; we ſhall but love, and we ſhall eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally rejoyce: or rather we need not aſk at all, for he will but preſent himſelf before us, and force us to love and rejoyce without any meaſure.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing it is a place of ſuch full ſatisfaction you will not queſtion its tranquillity and repoſe: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince it is (as you heard before you came hither) the very <hi>Viſion of Peace.</hi> The life which they lead there is ſo full of content, that they are not diſturbed by any paſſion, nor diſquieted by the violence and diſorder of any unruly affection. A life it is, void of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:101895:59"/>all ſadneſs, free from all grief, quit of all care, and rid of all anxiety of mind. Where there is no adverſary to aſſault, no forbidden fruit to tempt, no impetuous deſire of the fleſh to moleſt them, and no fear neither that ever they ſhall be haunted with theſe enemies of their peace and contentment. O how happy ſhould we find our ſelves if we were but come to the top of that high Mountain, which will ſeem the more clear and quiet, becauſe ſo many clouds have here ſo often overcaſt us, and ſo many ſudden blaſts have ruffled and diſcompoſed us. There we ſhall not accuſe one another of any injuries, becauſe we ſhall not do the leaſt; nor be troubled to purſue our right, becauſe we ſhall not be wronged. There we ſhall live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out jealouſies; and converſe (as I have told you) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuſpition; and paſs Eternity without any differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of opinion, or debates and controverſies in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which now are no ſmall diſeaſe and bring no little burden upon our hearts. Nay, the very actions of Piety many of them, will be of a different kind from what they now are, unattended with thoſe paſſions to which we are now moved, which make us ſuffer evil, while we do good. Here, as the forenamed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon well obſerved to me, we do good works, when we deal our bread to the hungry, and receive the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſtranger, and clothe the naked, which is a kind of affliction and tribulation which we indure by our ſympathy with them to whom we pay our Charity. For we find miſerable perſons on whom to exerciſe our Mercy, and the miſery which we ſee they lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, makes us compaſſionate, that is, to ſuffer with them. How much better then ſhall we be, when we ſhall find no hungry mouth to feed, no ſtranger to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain, no naked body to caſt our garments over, no
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:101895:59"/>ſick men to attend, no priſoner to viſit, no tormented perſon to commiſerate, no differences to compoſe, no contenders to reconcile: but our Love ſhall be of another ſort, all joy, all pleaſure in the good and in the perfect happineſs of every one that we behold. And if there were nothing elſe there to entertain us, but the comforts of that friendſhip I told you of, and the delights we ſhall interchange by a conſtant amity and good will, to one another; it were ſufficient to recommend this life to any wiſe mans affection, and make him willing to forſake this world, to go to a place of ſuch endleſs love and kindneſs.</p>
               <p>And, doth there now need any demonſtration that this is a place of great ſafety and ſecurity environ'd on all ſides with the power of God againſt the attempts of all the enemies of our happineſs? No ſure; for then we ſhould be in danger of ſome diſturbance. If we ſhould conceive indeed any forces could be gathered againſt it, and that it were not impregnable in it ſelf, we might eaſily imagine that ſo many troops of illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous friends, ſo many bands of holy Lovers as here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit, would perform ſtrange things againſt the moſt puiſſant Invaders. There is nothing, I told you, ſo ſtrong as Love by the force of which in one ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, incredible things have been atchieved: and therefore much greater would the united power of it appear in ſo many hoſts of noble ſpirits all inſpired with the higheſt degree of this affection, who would do their utmoſt for the ſervice and ſafety of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But yet we need not have recourſe to ſuch fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies as theſe, for the aſſurance of our peace in that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed place. It is impoſſible that any thing ſhould wound the quiet of ſuch happy ſouls, or make the leaſt breach
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:101895:60"/>in any of their enjoyments. There cannot be ſo much interruption given to them as the ſcratch of a pin among us amounts unto; becauſe they are out of the reach of the evil one, and placed in ſuch ſtill and calm Regions, where nothing breathes, but only that love and dear affection for ever.</p>
               <p>Upon which account alſo it is, that there can be no intermiſſion of their injoyments, no more than there will be interruption and diſturbance. It being a full and perfect happineſs, there will no time paſs wherein they will not be happy. The dayes there have no nights: The life hath no ſleep, which is but the Image of death. There will not be ſo much diverſion there from the proper exerciſes of that life, as meat and drink now creates, which are the preſent ſupport of our infirm bodies: Much leſs will there be any diſeaſe or decay of ſtrength, or the incumbrance of any of thoſe imployments which ingage ſo great a part of our time and thoughts. Our Love therefore ſhall never languiſh, or ſtand in need of any refreſhment; our charity ſhall not cool and abate its heat; our joy ſhall not exhauſt our ſpirits, and leave us dull by the exceſs of it, as here it ſometimes doth. But, as I ſaid before, we ſhall rather gather ſtrength, and grow more apt to receive an increaſe of joy, by the greatneſs and force of that which we have already received.</p>
               <p>I need but juſt remember you, it being a thing you have heard no doubt an hundred times, that this life of theirs is without any death: An eternal life (as the Holy Books call it) where we ſhall not have ſo much ſadneſs as the thoughts of its having an end would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get. But we ſhall rejoyce firſt, that we have ſo much,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:101895:60"/>and next of all, that we ſhall never have leſs, and then that we ſhall ſtill injoy more; and above all, that what we do enjoy ſhall live as long as God who is the cauſe of it, that is, for ever.</p>
               <p>I believe you are not weary of ſo delightful a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, yet leſt I ſhould keep you too long from the reſt of my Inſtructions, I ſhall ſhorten it as much as I can, and ſhut up this deſcription with a meditation of that devoute perſon, who, as I told you long ago, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the Guidance of men to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> 
                  <q>How different, ſaith he, is the life of thoſe in that place, from that of ours here? Here there is falſhood; there is truth. Here is perturbation; there is a faithful poſſeſſion. Here is bitterneſs and hatred, there is dilection and eternal love. Here is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous elation of mind, there is ſecure exultation of ſpirit. Here we are in doubt, whether they that love us may not change their thoughts; there is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual friendſhip, and no poſſibility of being ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Here whatſoever is good, we are afraid may periſh; there whatſoever we receive will be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by him that gave it. Here there is death, and there is nothing but life. Here we enjoy what the eye, and the ear, and our thoughts preſent unto us; but there we ſhall ſee what the eye hath not ſeen, and hear what the ear hath never heard, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what the heart cannot now comprehend: And ſeeing, hearing and knowing after that manner, we ſhall rejoyce with joy unſpeakable. For what kind of joy muſt that be, when thou ſeeſt thy ſelf in the company of Angels; a partner in the Kingdom of Heaven, to raign with the King of the world; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring nothing, to poſſeſs all things; rich, without
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:101895:61"/>covetouſneſs; charitable, without mony; triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without the fear of any barbarous Invaders; and living this life, without any death? O ſweet life! the more I think of thee, the more I love thee; the more vehemently I deſire thee; the more I am plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the remembrance of thee; I love to ſpeak of thee, I love to hear of thee, I love to write of thee, to confer of thee, to read of thee; that ſo I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the pains and the ſweat, and the dangers of this tedious life, by laying my weary head in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of thy ſecure pleaſures. For this end I enter into the Garden of the Holy Scriptures; I gather there the ſweet flowers of Divine Sayings; that which I gather, I eat; that which I eat, I chew over again; and that which I have taſted, I lay up in mine heart; that by ſuch ſweetneſs I may allay the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and irkſomeneſs of this miſerable life. O that my ſins were done away! O that laying aſide the burden of this fleſh, I might enter into thy eaſe and quiet! To receive the Crown of Life; to be aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the caeleſtial Singers; to behold the face of Chriſt; to ſee the uncircumſcribed light, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of death to rejoyce without any end. There is the goodly fellowſhip of the Prophets, there are the glorious twelve Apoſtles; there is an innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Army of Martyrs; there is the holy Company of Pious Confeſſors; there are the Divine Lovers of Solitude and Retirement; there are the holy Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that have overcome the infirmities of their ſex, and the powers of the world; there are the brave Youths and Virgins, whoſe holy manners tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their years; there are the Sheep and the Lambs that have eſcaped the danger of glutting themſelves with theſe earthly pleaſures; there perfect Charity
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101895:61"/>reigns, becauſe God is there All in All. There they ſee without fear, and love without meaſure, and praiſe without ceaſing. There loving they praiſe, and praiſing they love, and it is their work to do ſo alwaies without any interruption. But alas! Who can tell what a Great Good, God is? (as he proceeds in another place) Who can declare how full he is, or relate the happineſs that he will give us? We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell it, and yet we cannot hold our peace: It is more than can be uttered, and yet we cannot chuſe but talk of it. And if we cannot tell it becauſe of our ignorance, and yet cannot hold our tongues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of our joy for what we know; in what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are we, which will neither let us ſpeak, nor yet be ſilent? What ſhall we do with our ſelves, if we can neither tell what it is, nor yet ceaſe to ſpeak of it? Ile tell you in two or three words; Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce: Let us praiſe God: Let us keep a perpetual Jubilee here in our hearts: thanking him very much that we know ſo much of this happineſs; and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him more, that it is ſo great that we cannot know it all.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here, if the Guide had not made a little ſtop, I think the Pilgrim had interrupted him; for he had kept his ſilence thus long with great difficulty, and now cryed out with a more than ordinary vehemence; Bleſſed be God that he hath brought me to this place! This is none other than the ſuburbs of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> this is the Gate of Heaven. Happy was the day which let me ſee your face! I heard ſomething of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the hearing of the ear; but now mine eyes ſee it, and I am all inamoured of it. You have ſhown me a ſight ſo glorious, that it is beyond our thoughts, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:101895:62"/>beyond our deſires; I was going to ſay, beyond our Faith, and beyond our hope. Sure you are one of the Angels of God ſent from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to fetch me thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. You had inflamed me with an high Degree of Love before, but now you have put me in a fiery Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, and methinks I am not upon the earth, but aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to thoſe heavenly Regions. Nay, you have tranſported me to the City of God already. Methinks I ſee the Lord of Glory. I behold the Thrones that are erected for all the Noble Travellers to that Holy Land. I fancy my ſelf in the dear embraces of thoſe Glorious Lovers. And I am apt to embrace you as one of the Seraphims that have fired my ſoul with the ſame Love. I ſee the bleſſed Jeſus preparing himſelf for his appearance; and begin to think that I am triumphing with him. Or, if I am but in a dream of theſe things, yet it is ſo pleaſant, that I could wiſh it might laſt for ever; and that nothing might awake me out of ſuch a delightful ſlumber. Not ſo, ſaid his Guide (interrupting his ſpeech) I love you better than to let you enjoy ſuch a wiſh; and I would rouze you up to demonſtrate their reality, if I thought you took theſe things for charming dreams, and painted ſhadows. You ſhall not make ſuch a mean ſuppoſal, nor content your ſelf with ſuch aiery pleaſures; for I will make you know at once both that there is ſuch a bleſſed place as I have deſcribed; and diſcover to you more perfectly the way unto it. There is another dear name incloſed in thoſe words which I told you muſt alwaies be ſealed upon your heart, and that is the Holy JUSUS. On whom I do not intend that you ſhould look only as he ſits on his Throne of Glory at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but as he walked up and down the world, and was a Pilgrim like your ſelf travelling to that place. He publiſhed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:101895:62"/>the Glory of it; He brought life and immortality to light; He ſet open the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to all faithful Travellers; He run the Race himſelf wherein you are to follow; and for the joy that was ſet before him when he ſhould come thither, he was not aſhamed of a poorer habit than the meaneſt Pilgrim wears. If you take a view therefore of his life, and trace his holy ſteps; you cannot miſs the Rode which I would have you take, nor fail to be convinced that it can carry you to no other place but the City of God. For, Do you not remember that this perſon hath ſtiled himſelf the WAY? There is nothing ſo neceſſary than in all that ſentence as this one word <hi>Jeſus</hi> to have alwaies in your mind: whom I ſhall now deſcribe unto you as a fair Copy, not only of that <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> which I named before; but of all other things that you muſt reſolve to undertake if you mean to come at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

               <p>ANd firſt I muſt ſet this <hi>Jeſus</hi> before your eyes as one that was <hi>dead to theſe outward things while he lived among them; and that withdrew his heart from the world while he converſed with it.</hi> He was not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cloyſter'd and retir'd from the ſociety of men. He led not an Anchorets life, which obliged him to ſhun their company. Nor did he put on a ſullen gravity that ſhould affright men from his fellowſhip; but he
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:101895:63"/>uſed the greateſt freedom, and treated men with ſuch familiarity, that he invited them into it. He did eat and drink as other men do; he refuſed not their invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when they were deſirous to entertain him, and even at a Marriage he denyed not to be a Gueſt when his preſence was welcome to them. He had opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of inriching himſelf as well as other men. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours would have waited upon him if he had pleaſed, without a Miracle. It depended upon himſelf alone to become the greateſt man in the world. And the pleaſures which others ſeek would have purſued him, if he had but given them encouragement. Herein he made himſelf glorious, and hath left us a noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; that he was mortified to all theſe carnal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, when they were ready to thruſt themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; that he denyed the deſires of wealth, when it would coſt him no more pains, than to receive it; and that he refuſed all the Kingdoms of the world, which would have eaſily diſpoſed themſelves to his obedience. He walkt into Cities and Towns; and was ſtill as unſpotted from the world, as he was in a wilderneſs. He lived in the thickeſt of its temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but none of them could faſten or ſtick upon him. He had power at will, and his will ſet bounds to it when it had none of its own. He was a Soveraign Lord, but made no advantage thereby, ſave only to be better, and to do more good than any of his ſubjects. He uſed greater moderation in all injoyments, than thoſe did on whom he beſtowed them. He lived in a ſenſe of the Spiritual World, while he was a man of this, and incompaſſed about with our infirmities. He was a ſtranger to all the evil manners and cuſtoms of men while he was familiar with themſelves; and he teſtified againſt their wicked deeds while he kept
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:101895:63"/>them company: Nay he purified many by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, remaining uncorrupted by any of theirs. And truly ſuch a life it is that you are to lead. Your way to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> lyes through the World. You muſt not think to ſtep into none but Religious Houſes, or to fall into no company, but that of the Pious: much leſs muſt you expect to lye immur'd from the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Vanity; and to ſecure your ſelf from tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions within the incloſure of high walls which they cannot climb over to approach you. But your man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life will lead you through the crowd: your way will bring you into open fields, and expoſe you oftentimes to the throng of ſenſual objects; againſt which you will have no defence but your own valour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſolution. You will not be able to refuſe them your company, or to paſs along without their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. It will not be at your choice whether you will ſee, and hear, and feel thoſe things that are amiable and delightful: nor can you ſtop your ears ſo cloſe but you will perceive they invite you to a friendſhip with them. Your ſkill and your courage therefore conſiſts in this; that in imitation of your Maſter <hi>Jeſus</hi> you live and converſe with all theſe things as a man that is <hi>Dead.</hi> You muſt keep them company in ſuch a ſort, that they may find it is but the ſhadow of you that is among them, and that they do not poſſeſs your ſelf. Let them know that they may as well invite a Ghoſt to their intemperance, uncleanneſs and greedineſs of the world, as waſte their time in ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciting of your affection. Make them feel, that is but half of you and the worſer half which walks among them; and that it is impoſſible they ſhould have the better part. Let men have your company, but be not partaker with them in their ſins. Follow your affairs
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:101895:64"/>like other folk, but take heed and beware of covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and watch that you be not overtaken with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting and drunkenneſs or the cares of this life. Let the World underſtand that you can ſee it every day, and not fall in love with it: that you can deal and traffique with it if need be, and yet not be unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: that you can behold all its honours and not be ambitious: that you need not hide your eyes from its beauties, and yet retain your own and live in purity of heart. Beware of pleaſing and humouring any of your ſenſes. Suffer them not to feed too greedily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any object, leſt your ſoul be inchanted and caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a forgetfulneſs of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And remember al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes that you are to ſue all theſe earthly things ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of neceſſity, then of choice: and to afford them your company but not your friendſhip.</p>
               <p>And this, let me tell you, is a more excellent and uſeful life, I may add more laborious too, then any other; though the auſterities of Monks and Hermites ſeem ſo grievous and horribly affrighting. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the ſharpneſs they injoyn themſelves, they reap a great deal of eaſe who are ſequeſtred from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick offices and live without the incumbrance of many affairs. Though their Rules to which they are tyed appear ſo rigorous, yet they are neither ſo many in number, nor ſo thorny in their nature, nor have ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faces, as thoſe which bind a man of exact integrity in civil life. They have but a few things to imploy them, and he is ingaged in a multitude: and they have the ſame things to do over again, but his rules vary with a thouſand circumſtances. It is a pleaſure to avoid the pains of well doing among thoſe that are evil. It is a repoſe to have but few enemies and thoſe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:101895:64"/>ſuch as have been beaten an hundred times. Theſe people may have ſome other glory, but that of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming difficulties methinks belongs not to them. Moderation is a vertue much more toilſome, then their Sufferance. That hath a thouſand ſeveral faſhions, whereas this hath no more then one. It is no wonder that a man ſhould be good where he ſees nothing that is bad. He may well keep his innocence where it is hard to loſe it: and ſoon ſecure his ſoul when there is nothing offers to rob him of it. He is a very unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate man (as I have heard ſomebody well expreſs it) who drowns himſelf in that place, where he can ſcarce find water enough to quench his thirſt. His hap is exceeding hard who ſhall take a ſurfet, where there is ſcarce ſo much victuals as will break ones faſt, But when we are throng'd with temptations, and beſet with enemies; when there is a battery planted againſt every gate, and not one of our ſenſes is free from aſſault: then it is a buſineſs of ſome labour and it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves praiſe, to ſecure our ſouls and to defend them bravely in ſuch a violent ſtorm. To eſcape drowning when we are upon the Sea, when the winds are boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous, the channel dangerous, and we are caſt among rocks and have ſhelves and quickſands very near us on the right hand and on the left; is a buſineſs that calls for an excellent ſkill, and a very even ſteerage, and ſuch an experience as cannot be learned without a great deal of pains and diligence. Then Piety will thank us for our Love, when we are courted by Vice. And we ſhall ſeem to have done ſome honour to Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by cleaving to her, when we had large offers to become bad. So that I cannot ſee by what merit the <hi>Secluſe</hi> do aſſume to themſelves the title of <hi>Religious</hi> more then others: ſeeing they give a greater proof of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:101895:65"/>their Vertue who are in the World and the World is not in them; then thoſe in whom indeed the World is not, but they alſo are not in the World. It is more glorious to beat an enemy, then to fly away from him; and it requires a greater ſpirit to maintain a Breach, then to hold out within the Walls.</p>
               <p>Not that I diſcommend Solitude at your firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out, or would have you neglect it at certain ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons through your whole journey (for you ſhall know the uſe of it better hereafter) but it is not fit to deſign to live alwayes in ſecret, if it be poſſible to live and be ſafe in the World. This I would have you think is the more perfect life and more like to our Saviours: and therefore aſpire to it; and ſtay not in the other any longer, then only to fit and prepare your ſelf for this. And tell me I beſeech you; do you not think it poſſible for a man to have his heart in the World when his legs and arms are out of it? May it not dwell in his fancy when he ſees it not with his eyes? May he not pleaſe himſelf in the ſhaddow and image of his old friend which he ſayes is dead and buried? May not one leave his ſoul behind when he withdraws his body from all the World? I wiſh there be not many of ſuch Religious men and women. As on the contrary I hope there are not a few whoſe minds and hearts are ſhut up from the World, though they are with it every day. Who have made a Cloyſter for their ſouls, while their bodies are at liberty. Who bridle their appetites and lay reſtraints on their deſires; though they live at large and are under no Vow but that of their Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Conſider therefore how ridiculous it is to imitate
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:101895:65"/>another ſort of men, who hearing us ſpeak of forſaking the World, and renouncing all its Pomps and Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; imagine that they ſhould throw away their rich garments, forbear the civility of a complement or ſo much as a ſalutation, let their Gardens become wilderneſſes, and their Pictures make fires, with abundance of ſuch like follies. Alas! what have theſe poor things done that we ſhould revenge our ſelves upon them? what is their guilt that we ſhould be ſo ſevere and fierce againſt them? Is this the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification the Scripture ſpeaks of to execute our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon inſenſible things? It would ſeem more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable if when a man reads of <hi>crucifying the fleſh,</hi> he ſhould go and pierce his own body and ſtrike nails through his hands and his feet. And yet what blame doth it lye under, that we ſhould put it to that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? or what is that which we kill by ſuch cruelty? No, no, we muſt turn the blow another way. We muſt cut off our affections from theſe worldly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. We muſt walk in the fleſh, but not after it. We may feel its deſires, but not follow them. We muſt labour to become poor in the midſt of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; to be humble in high places; to be temperate amongſt the baits of pleaſure; to uſe thoſe things well which cuſtome hath abuſed; to think of our ſelves in fine clothes, juſt as we did before they came on our backs. And in a few words, to withdraw our ſelves from all the inveiglements of the world, not in the common way of removing our perſons from it, but by removing it from our eſteem and affections.</p>
               <p>But I am affraid of running into that errour which I purpoſed to avoid, if I ſhould continue to give ſuch a large and punctual account of all that the Good man
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:101895:66"/>ſaid in this Argument. And therefore I will keep more exactly to my method in what inſues and contract the reſt of his diſcourſes concerning <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You muſt look upon <hi>Jeſus</hi> (proceeded he) in the next place, as a perſon <hi>that was highly contented and very liberal in the midſt of the greateſt Poverty.</hi> It would have been little leſs then a wonder (as the world now goes) if I had ſaid that he thought he had enough though all the ground he trod upon had been his own; and that he was bountiful though he had been able to pave his way with Silver and Gold. But he hath left us an higher pattern and taught us even in our Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be charitable to thoſe who are reduced to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter neceſſities, and in the meaneſt condition to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleaſed, then worldly men are in the greateſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities and abundance. He had no lands nor year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revenues, and yet the Hoſpitality was noble which he maintained. His incomes were uncertain, and yet he never complain'd or troubled his mind becauſe his eſtate was no better aſſured. His Diſciples were men of a ſmall fortune, and yet he labours to infuſe into them a moſt liberal diſpoſition. He ſtuck not to ſpend all the victuals he had upon the hungry multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. He choſe to lay out the whole proviſion of his numerous family in one feaſt, rather then ſuffer them to faint who were come to hear his Word. Though he lived as a Begger himſelf, yet he kept a purſe for the Poor. Though he was ſupported by the Charity of others, yet he would be no more then their Steward and receive their Alms to give it away. Great perſons miniſtred to him, but he himſelf was the Miniſter of all. His Poverty might have inriched himſelf, but he choſe by it to inrich others. And this truly ſeems to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:101895:66"/>have been the proper effect of his being dead to the World. He felt no need of its Riches, and ſo he did not covet them. And he did not let them into his heart when they came to him, and ſo he was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to part with them. He thought the goodneſs of all theſe things conſiſted in their Uſe; and he knew no better imployment for them, then to ſend them to ſerve thoſe who were preſſed with want. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore better pleaſe him, then by imitating this bounteous diſpoſition. There will nothing more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear you to him, then ſuch a generoſity, which may ſhew it ſelf in a mean as well as in a plentiful fortune. Do you not obſerve what praiſes he beſtows upon a poor widow who had caſt all her living into the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſtock? It ſeems to me that this was a more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſpectacle to him, then all the offerings of the Rich. Read but his famous Sermon which he made to his followers, and there you will find ſo many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of taking no care for meat and drink and clothes; and of giving away hoping for nothing again, that you will think he had a mind to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to them this contentedneſs and Charity above all things elſe. And leaſt you ſhould fancy that all the acts of his Charity were miracles, which are no examples to us; or be like the Hypocrites who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine his precepts were given to upbraid our weakneſs and reproach to us our fall, rather then to direct our practiſe: obſerve the ſmart Queſtion which he aſks toward the concluſion of that Sermon, <hi>Why call you me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I ſay?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 6.46.</note> As if he ſhould have ſaid; are you not aſhamed to call me your Maſter and yet do nothing that I command? What miſchief is this, that you ſhould acknowledge mine Authority, and yet not be governed by my Will?
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:101895:67"/>Away with this Hypocriſie; Cali me Lord no more, when you will neither do as I ſay, nor as I do. The very ſame words ſhould I now ſay to you, if I did not think that you were reſolved to tread in his ſteps; and that you eſteemed poverty with contentment the greateſt riches; and a liberal heart with a ſmall eſtate, the largeſt poſſeſſions. You will not fail I know to ſcatter your Charity as you go along to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> If you meet with any diſtreſſed perſon in your way; you will be ſure to do like the good Samaritan and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for his health and deliverance. Nay, ſpare not to ſeek for opportunities to do good: and ſince we live in an ill natur'd and hard-hearted age, let your light ſo ſhine before men that they may ſee <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſtill in the world. And indeed I have often beheld to my great aſtoniſhment a poor Pilgrim give more largely to a charitable uſe, then a perſon of high condition in the World. There are many Rich Gluttons who will beſtow more upon their Dogs, then upon a needy <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus.</hi> I have heard men wonder they are not aſhamed to ſee themſelves out-done by people of a meaner rank; and that they do not fear the bowels of the Poor will groan againſt them and complain to heaven of their unmercifulneſs: But ſo it is, that they have hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their own bowels toward them, and think that heaven is as inſenſible of all their cryes as themſelves. Their hearts are as cold as ſtones; and you may as ſoon move a Statue to do good as one of theſe Images of men. They are not crucified to the world, but they are killed in her embraces and ſhe hath hug'd them to death in her arms. The world hath poured too many of her favours upon them and preſſed them to death with the weight of Silver and Gold. Their hands are faſt cloſed, their fingers are ſtiff and rigid:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:101895:67"/>they hold their money ſo hard, that a dead mans hand cannot be more inflexible, nor hold that thing harder which he graſps when he is juſt expiring. Nothing but the example of the Lord of Life will be of any power to get them open. There is none but himſelf can breathe ſuch a ſpirit into them, as will looſen the cold bands of death, and make them ſtretch forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the relief of their periſhing neighbours. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound therefore this pattern every where in your practice: and if men like not to be the followers of Chriſt on theſe terms, tell them they muſt look for their wages at the Devils hands. He hath as faſt hold of thoſe miſers ſouls, as they have of their money. Hell is as greedy as their deſires. It gapes for them, as they do inſatiably for Riches. And beſides, if there be any truth in our ſacred Books, they, and their riches, and their poſterity, ſhall rot and become as vile as thoſe whoſe miſeries they will not pitty.</p>
               <p>And when you have well affected your heart with this heavenly-minded and compaſſionate <hi>Jeſus,</hi> then turn your eyes to another ſight, and behold in him <hi>the deepeſt humility, and the moſt profound lowlineſs of mind, joyned with the greateſt perfections, and higheſt abilities that ever any man had.</hi> If there were ever any man in the world that had cauſe to bear himſelf high, this was the perſon. His indowments were divine; his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were inſpirations; his words were oracles; and yet blocks and truncks are wont now to lift up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves higher in their own conceit than he could be tempted to do. Never had any one ſo large a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that boaſted ſo little of it. His power was not to be equall'd on earth, and yet it did not domineen over the meaneſt creature. He could do what he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:101895:68"/>would with a word; but would not imploy the leaſt breath in his own praiſes. The very hemm of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was thought to be of a miraculous virtue, but it was touched with pride as much as himſelf. The wonders which he did, were alwaies accompanied with another wonder, that he took not the honour of them, but gave it to God. He was dead indeed not only to the outward world, but alſo to himſelf. He was not only inſenſible of the blandiſhments of fleſhly pleaſures, but of the flatteries of ſpiritual pride. He wrought ſuch Miracles as to raiſe the dead, but they could never raiſe any ſelf-conceit, nor give vain-glory in him any life. He would have concealed his works, if Gods Glory had not been concerned in them more than his own. He would have ſtopt the peoples mouth as well as his own breath; and ſtifled ſame as much as others ſeek to give it air, if it had not been for the good of the world that he ſhould be known. And therefore when the fame of him did fly abroad, it could carry no other news but that he was as humble as he was great. When he was ſo high in the peoples eſteem, that they would have advanced him to be a King, he choſe rather to remain a private man: When they would have carried him into a Pallace, and made him a Court, he liked better to ſteal away into a Deſart. Poor men were his Companions; Fiſhermen and the meaner ſort he took for his Attendants. When he was in his greateſt triumph, he was meek and lowly riding upon an Aſs. When his ears was filled with <hi>Hoſanna's,</hi> he was going to humble himſelf to the ſhameful death of the Croſs. He was in truth no other than the King of courteſie and humility. A Prince that liſtned to the petitions of the pooreſt Supplicants; that ſtood ſtill to hear the cryes of blind Beggars; that would
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:101895:68"/>not refuſe a work of Charity becauſe of its vileneſs; and in one word, that ſtooped ſo low as to waſh his Diſciples feet, which was the meaneſt office of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. I need not tell you ſure for what purpoſe he did this, ſeeing he himſelf hath ſaved me the labour by that ſpeech of his to thoſe whom he had ſo waſhed,<note place="margin">Joh. 13.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>I have given you an example, that you ſhould do as I have done to you.</hi> Let me ſay to you therefore as he doth preſently after to thoſe perſons, <hi>If you know theſe things,</hi>

                  <hi>happy are you if you do them.</hi> You muſt lay your ſelf as low as the duſt you tread upon in the way to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> You muſt not ſtudy Fame ſo much as Virtue. You muſt acknowledge God in all, and magnifie your ſelf in nothing. You muſt raiſe a name to him, and not ſeek your own renown. When you are praiſed, you muſt be the ſame that you are when men diſcommend you. You muſt think it dangerous to aſpire to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and hunt after promotions. Let them find you as unwilling to receive them, as others are to forbear their Courtſhip towards them. Condeſcend to men of low eſtate, and ſort your ſelf familiarly with thoſe who are below you. Let the poor never be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of your ſcorn, but think that pride doth render you poorer and more deſpicable than them. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to ſtoop to the meaneſt offices of Love, whereby you may ſerve your Brethren; and when you have done them, think that they are to be done again when their needs require them. And that I may not ſeem to impoſe any heavy burden upon you, do but look at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſee how <hi>Jeſus</hi> is advanced by humbling himſelf; and you will not need any exhortation to this Virtue which before I ſo much praiſed, and now again commend to your affection. Many of the Angels, they ſay, made it their ſtudy to raiſe themſelves higher than
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:101895:69"/>they were, but miſcarried in the enterpriſe, and were not able to effect it. They tryed their wings, and began to ſoar aloſt, but they failed them ſadly, and let them ſuffer a ſhameful fall. But <hi>Jeſus,</hi> on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſtudied to be a great deal lower than he was; not only lower than the Angels, but inferiour to men, even the vileſt of men. The iſſue of which was, that you ſee him exalted at Gods right hand, and he hath raiſed himſelf thereby, not only to the places from whence thoſe Angels fell; but to ſuch a dignity that he is higher than all principalities and powers, and hath the nobleſt creatures put in ſubjection under his feet. Be a follower of <hi>Jeſus</hi> therefore in his Humility, depreſſing your ſelf as low as you can in your own thoughts; for that is the way to raiſe your ſelf to the higheſt pitch of Glory, and to be made equal to the Angels of God, who have kept their ſtation, and alwaies had their dwelling at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And it may not be amiſs the more effectually to excite you, if you conſider how thoſe noble perſons have preſerved their firſt habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and remained ſo long in the Caeleſtial Court. Was it not by humbling themſelves to the meaneſt imployments, to which the Soveraign of all orders and ranks of being in the world was pleaſed to aſſign them? Are they not content to come and wait upon the pooreſt of us, and to ſerve as a Guard to the moſt abject of the Sons of Men? Let us not refuſe then to ſubmit to any condition of life, wherein our wiſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour thinks good to place us, nor imagine any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice below us, in which we may be uſeful and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our neighbours. If we had no greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample than the Angels, it might well be expected that we ſhould not diſdain to appear in the meaneſt dreſs; but ſince the Lord of them all is pleaſed to become our
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:101895:69"/>pattern, and to abaſe himſelf far lower than they, it ſhould make us love to be all over covered with this Humility, and to eſteem it the moſt glorious Robe that we can wear. And truly if our hearts were touched with ſuch a Charity to others as He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued withall, we ſhould not ſtick to bow our ſelves, though we were never ſo high, to the vileſt ſervices, for the ſuccour and help of thoſe whoſe miſeries im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored our aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Let me propoſe to you therefore the bleſſed Jeſus in the next place, as a perſon that was very <hi>full of love, tenderneſs and bowels of compaſſion towards thoſe that deſerved nothing, nay, towards thoſe that deſerved ill at his hands.</hi> He was ſo diſpoſed to do good, that they could not miſs of his kindneſs, who neither deſired it, nor were willing when it was offered to receive it. He did not only pitty the weakneſs and infirmity of his Diſciples; but had a feeling of the ſufferings of thoſe who were ſtrangers: neither was he only kind and benigne towards Supplicants; but his heart was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the perverſe, untoward, and ungrateful people. There was nothing of roughneſs, ſowreneſs and uncivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in his manners; but they were ſmooth, ſweet and full of Courteſie. His heart was not at all pinched and narrowed by the Love of himſelf; but it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged into ſuch an univerſal Charity, that he ſeemed to forget his own concerns, the better to provide for the good of others. The Inſtances of his benignity and good nature are ſo many, that to reckon them all, would be as long as to tell a ſtory of his whole life; for <hi>he went about doing good.</hi> It was his work and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to do benefits to the world. He was the Sun of Righteouſneſs, that run a long race for no other
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:101895:70"/>prize, but only to have the honour of ſpending his beams. He rejoyced to ſpread his healing wings over every place. It was his pleaſure to ſhed his influences, and to make all that ſaw him ſenſible of his flames. The Patients that ſolicited his healing-power were innumerable; and the Cures which he wrought were not fewer than they. He lived all his time in a kind of Hoſpital; being thronged with ſick men, with <hi>Lazers,</hi> and other diſeaſed folks. And though it were turned ſometimes to a Bedlam, by the company of Daemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acks, and phrenetical people; yet he never complained of the burden, but chearfully entertained the occaſion of putting them in poſſeſſion of their wits again. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did he ſend any man away without ſatisfaction to his deſires; but he caſt out Devils, cleanſed their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſies, cured their Palſies, untied the tongue of the dumb, opened the eyes of the blind, reſtored feet to the lame; and beſides, relieved their neceſſities, had compaſſion on their hunger, and fed their bodies and their ſouls both together. The whole Country ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be his family, and if he had been the Father of them all, he could not have been more tender, or yearned with greater bowels of mercy towards them. The oppoſition and contradiction of brutiſh men did not alter the ſweetneſs of his diſpoſition towards them; but he continued to do them good, to beſeech and entreat them, to weep over them, and ſigh for their Infidelity. And when it grew to ſuch an height, that they ſought to kill him who had ſaved the lives of ſo many; yet ſo great was his Charity, that he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by their offences; ſought not for revenge, which it was eaſie for him to find; and to ſpeak all in one word, forgave the moſt ungrateful enemies that ever were. I believe you will eaſily grant, that it is a
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:101895:70"/>matter of leſs difficultie to forgive the injuries we receive from one that never was obliged to us; then to pardon him to whom we have expreſſed the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt kindneſs, and uſed with the higheſt civility, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if his malice ariſe ſo high as to ſeek our life. And yet ſo loving was our Lord, and ſo deſirous to ſet us a noble example; that he never expreſſed greater Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, than when he had the greateſt reaſon to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed. He freely remitted the wrongs of thoſe who not only hated him without a cauſe, but who had great cauſe to love him above all the world. And though the wrongs were as great as the benefits he had beſtowed, and they were beyond all meaſure; yet as his benefits did not make them become his friends, ſo their wrongs could not make him become their enemy. What greater malignity is there than that which moves men to bereave others of their life? and what greater Charity than that which endeavours to preſerve it? We can conceive of none higher, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be this, to ſacrifice our own life for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of other mens; eſpecially of theirs that take it away. And ſuch was the Love of our Lord, who was ſo great a friend to ſo great enemies as ſought for that which he was ready to offer for them. You know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well his words upon the Croſs, when he made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for the tranſgreſſors, ſaying, <hi>Father, forgive them.</hi> Could he more effectually at that time teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his kindneſs than by ſuch an indulgence in the midſt of their cruelty toward him? What do we expect more from a Parent, than that he ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the faults of his children when they repent and ſubmit themſelves to him? And yet our Lord uſes theſe men with greater clemency, and gives them his pardon whilſt they were committing of the fault. Nay,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:101895:71"/>he not only forgave them himſelf; but deſires God to grant them remiſſion too, that he might be the only ſufferer, and they be free from puniſhment.</p>
               <p>You ſee then how your way lyes if you will travel to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and deſire to be with <hi>Jeſus.</hi> The rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your way and the aſperities of mens manners, muſt not ſpoil the ſmoothneſs of your ſoul nor exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate your ſpirit: but you muſt be loving and kind to all, even to the greateſt offenders. Nay, if your nature be crabbed and auſtere, you muſt look ſo ſtedfaſtly upon <hi>Jeſus</hi> and ſteep your thoughts ſo long there, till he infuſe himſelf into you and change the harſhneſs of your diſpoſition into a ſweeter humour. The way to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> I aſſure you is full of ſad ſpectacles which will afford you no other pleaſure but that of having a tender ſenſe of their miſeries and doing of them good. You muſt be civil and affable to every one you meet upon the rode. You muſt pitty and ſuccour thoſe who are ready to periſh. You muſt counſel and adviſe the Ignorant and thoſe who are out of the way. You muſt bleſs thoſe that throw a curſe at you as you go along. You muſt pray for thoſe that do you wrong. And if any fellow-traveller to whom you have afforded your help ſhould prove a robber and make an aſſault upon you; you muſt ſtill preſerve your love to him and not ſuffer him to rifle you of your grace to forgive him. And indeed when we conſider how much more reaſon there is that we ſhould do good to others, then that God ſhould do good to us; and when we think alſo how much more he hath done for us then we can do for others; and when we remember withall that they are our equals in the chiefeſt things, and that in ſome they may be our ſuperiours, when as he is ſo much
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:101895:71"/>above us in all; it will ſet our hearts wide open and make them free and generous, though they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo faſt locked and barred before; and render them ſoft and tender though they were as hard and ſtubborn as bolts of Iron. We ſhall not then be back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to forgive injuries, to do good to enemies, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay wrongs with courteſies, to bear with mens folly and weakneſs, to envy no mans proſperity, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the good of all as if it were our own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But poor <hi>Pilgrims</hi> will find themſelves in ſuch need of the charitable help and comfort of others, that I think it is not neceſſary to preſs you any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to this thing which will be nothing more, then <hi>to do to all as you would that all ſhould do to you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let me therefore proceed to tell you how <hi>Jeſus bore the contumelies, reproaches, and ſlanders of others with the greateſt meekneſs, though he was a perſon of the greateſt quality, and of the higheſt dignity and worth.</hi> No man ever did things with a better grace or deſerved more to be accepted with admiration and praiſe; and yet there never was any perſon entertained with greater ſcorn, or ſuffered more obloquies and ignominious uſage from the World. But did he receive them with that choler and wrath which they who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>High Spirits</hi> do ſuffer their ſouls to be tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all? No ſuch matter; but he was dumb as a Lamb before the ſhearers and did not ſo much as open his mouth; though conſidering his high birth and the manner of other men, he was tempted to roar like a Lyon and ſpeak with a voice of thunder againſt his inſolent deſpiſers. I will not recite all the vilifying language, nor give you a catalogue of the contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions which he was affronted with; but leave
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:101895:72"/>it to your own diligence to obſerve them, and together therwith the mildneſs of his ſpirit and the admirable temper and moderation of his mind in the ſharpeſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations to anger and diſpleaſure. When they called him Devil he confuted the calumny by not ſuffering the leaſt ſpark of that helliſh fire to kindle. When they ſaid he was an impoſtor and came to deceive the world, he was only excited thereby more boldly to ſpeak the Truth. And when they charged him with treaſon he aſſerted his innocency by no other means, then ſubjection of himſelf to the vileſt death. When they ſcourged him on the back and buffeted his face; he did not return them ſo much as a laſh or a blow with his tongue. When they committed all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages that could be deviſed upon him, they only ſerved to prove how free he was from paſſion and rage. Which methinks ſhould be ſufficient to cool the boiling heats of the fierceſt ſpirits; and to quench the intemperate fires that burn in the moſt inraged minds. There is no man that can boaſt of ſuch an extraction as his, or that can indure ſuch indignities: and therefore it is inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable that mens paſſion and anger ſhould take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from the quality of their perſons or the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the reproaches that are offered to them. No, the nobleſt men in the World ought to extinguiſh theſe flames by ſuch a glorious example, and to put up offences and ſcorns quietly without anſwering and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the like again. And I beſeech you to learn this leſſon well if ever you mean to arrive at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> You will have very great uſe of it, and will find it impoſſible to hold on in your journey unleſs you be fortified with this meekneſs of ſpirit and can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be deſpiſed and ſet at naught, to be eſteemed a fool, an ideot, or any thing elſe that men pleaſe to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:101895:72"/>call you while you are about Gods buſineſs and doing his will among them. The very way to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is loadned with many reproaches, and therefore they who are in it muſt not expect to have a priviledge of ſuſtaining none of them. A man cannot take a Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage through ſuch a world as this, and meet with no affront and unworthy uſage in his paſſage. Your very habit and faſhion, I mean your manners and courſe of life are ſo different from theirs, that they will not love you, though in all things elſe you pleaſe them well enough. A mortified life is a reproach to thoſe who are diſſolute. And if they cannot find in their heart to diſcommend <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it is a grievous rebuke to them that they do not travel with you thither. You diſturb them ſo much, that you muſt either have their company, or their calumnies. They muſt either do well, or ſpeak ill of your doings. They are exaſperated hereby to ſlander you, that they may juſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and to follow you with backbiting language, to excuſe their not following of your pious life.</p>
               <p>It is the part now of a gallant ſpirit to deſpiſe their revilings as much as they deſpiſe you. You cannot expreſs greater magnanimity then to neglect theſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle barkings, and not ſo much as lift up your ſtaff againſt thoſe that purſue you with them. Let them know that they are below your anger, and that your reſolution is not to be moved by their petulant ſpeeches. As you think that Temples and Kings Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces are not diſhonoured when the dogs that come by do lift up their legs againſt them;<note place="margin">Julian. Orat.</note> ſo you muſt not think your ſelf the worſe for the diſreſpects, the aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and contemptuous language that you meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in the world; but be as little concerned in them as
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:101895:73"/>you are in the rudeneſs of thoſe impudent creatures. Let them not have ſo much power over you as to make your tongue ſtir, unleſs it be to bleſs them: impoſe a perfect ſilence on your ſelf except it be to ſpeak to God and not to anſwer them. But of this ill treatment which you muſt expect, and your meek indurance of it, I ſhall have further occaſion to admoniſh you ſome other time.</p>
               <p>Let me now lead you to take a ſhort glance <hi>of his admirable Patience under unheard-of ſufferings, though he was a perſon no leſs ſenſible of pain, then he was innocent and deſerved to be freed from it.</hi> For which I ſhall refer you to the Hiſtory of his bloody and cruel Death where you will behold an heart ſo reſigned to God, that the greateſt torments could not make it recoil back into Self, nor ſeek for eaſe in any other place then in union with his Will. All that I ſhall ſay in this argument is, that you muſt learn thereby to indure all things with a conſtant ſubmiſſion to the Divine pleaſure and appointment, without thoſe murmurings and complaints which are apt to accompany the croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of our Deſire. For we have a great deal more reaſon to do ſo then He, in as much as though we may be innocent toward men, yet we are not ſo toward God; and if our offences were puniſhed according to our deſert, they would receive a ſharper chaſtiſement then that which we indure. He ſuffered for well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and we for ill; He bore other mens faults and we our own; he indured much and we little: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will be a great ſhame if when our ſufferings are little, our repineings are great, and when we ſuffer what we deſerve, it makes us ſo reſtleſs and impatient that we add to our ill deſervings. I pray you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:101895:73"/>to fortifie your ſelf with a great ſtock of this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Patience, for I muſt tell you ere long a number of things that will try its mettle, and ſhow you in what great need you will ſtand of it in your way to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the preſent I will divert your thoughts from theſe ſad ſpectacles and carry you to more pleaſant contemplations. Behold then how <hi>Jeſus was much with God by Meditation, Prayer and devout affection, in the midſt of all his buſineſs, and in a great crowd of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and attendants.</hi> He lived as I ſaid in the World but in that he ſought for ſolitary places and abſtracted thoughts. When he was with the people He never forgat God: upon all occaſions He took notice of him, and in whatſoever he did acknowledged him. But beſides he deviſed many times of retirement, and was wont upon a remove to ſend his Diſciples away before, that he might ſtay alone with him. Nay ſo deſirous he was of this heavenly Solitude, that ſometimes he continued a whole night together in Prayer and holy thoughts. And ſo truly would I have you do in your Travels: Take the advantage of any Shades or Groves that you ſhall meet withall, for ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and diſcourſe between God and your Soul. Repoſe your ſelf as long as you can in thoſe cool and ſtill places, and there invite heaven into your Society and prepare your ſelf for the preſent it will make you of the beſt of its bleſſings. Nay, I would have you form to your ſelf ſuch occaſions as oft as you are able, and contrive opportunities for privacy and incloſed thoughts. Build a great many little Arbours with your own hands, into which you may withdraw your ſelf and be alone. Get out of the throng, and make
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:101895:74"/>all affairs give way to the intertainment that God will give your ſoul in his bleſſed company. Bid them ſtand aſide a while and not preſume to diſturb the buſineſs which you have above. Let every thing underſtand that you are entred into an holy place, whither they muſt not dare to approach. And when you are thus ſequeſtred, let me tell you this for your comfort, that you will have the faireſt proſpect before your eyes that is to be found on this ſide <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> You will ſee the Glory of God that ſhines in all the world; you will hear the muſick which all his creatures make in his praiſe; you will be raviſhed with the taſte of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which you will feel him pouring out on every ſide; and in one word you will behold ſo much of the Beauty of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it ſelf, that you will travel with the better courage thither. But that in which I would have you ſpend the greateſt part of thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſeaſons, is in thinking of your own eſtate and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring your life with the life of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Let him be your companion when you are alone: look ſtedfaſtly on his face and obſerve what reſemblance you bear to him. Pray him to draw and deſcribe himſelf more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly upon your ſoul, and to ſupply all the lines that are ſtill wanting to render you an accompliſhed image of him. Shew him how deſirous you are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in all your thoughts, words, deſires and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to that excellent model of perfection which he hath given you in his own example. Let him know how much you are in love with him, and that you wiſh for this above all the world, to be like to him. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought that he will deny your deſires, or let your indeavours want his help for the making you more compleat in him. You will come out of theſe ſecret places with a greater luſtre and iſſue forth with
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:101895:74"/>a greater force and power to follow the ſteps of your Saviour. Your face will be indued with ſuch a bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and caſt ſuch a ſplendor round about, that it will be ſeen by all that you have been with <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Who can expreſs the pleaſures that hide themſelves in theſe retreats? or tell the contentments that are locked up in thoſe unfrequented cloſets? Do but enter into the firſt of them that preſents it ſelf, and there will need nothing more then the ſenſible delectation which you will find in it, to invite you to ſeek ſuch ſilent retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Theſe quiet places are the reſemblances of the ſerene regions above, and little models of heaven. They are hung round about alſo with a great many Pictures of <hi>Jeſus</hi> which will raviſh your heart and draw it out of your body to ſnatch it up to himſelf. In one corner you will ſee him pictured as the Lover of men; and in another you will behold him in the greateſt abaſement and humility that ever was. On this ſide you will ſee him dealing his Charity to the Poor, and on that he will diſcover himſelf attending on the ſick. Here his Meekneſs, there his Patience will be lively repreſented to your eyes. In one place you will find him pouring out his Inſtructions, and in another pouring out his Blood for the Good of men. And from every one of theſe you will receive ſuch touches and feel your heart ſo wounded; that you will never be more inamoured of him then when you and he thus meet alone and he makes this private viſit to your Soul. There he will open his very heart to you and let you ſee how much you are in his favour. There he will impart to you his conſolations and fill you with his Spirit. Your mind will there be illuminated, your affections inflamed, your reſolutions ſtrengthned, and all your faculties invigorated with a greater chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:101895:75"/>in obedience to his Will. And therefore do not fail as oft as you can to get out of the duſt and heat of this World into theſe cloſe and cool walks which <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> frequents. For though the dews of the Divine grace fall every where, yet they lye longeſt in the ſhade. Theſe ſugar'd drops do love moſt to ſtay in the ſolitary places. And when you can find no where elſe this milk of heaven wherewith all things are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and refreſhed; you will be ſure to meet with plenty of it in theſe hidden receſſes.</p>
               <p>But then I muſt remember you, <hi>That in the greateſt, moſt open and full manifeſtations of the Glory of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Jeſus, he was very private too, and cared not for having it publiſhed and talkt of abroad in the world.</hi> When he was transfigured in the Holy mount, you read that he went aſide <hi>privately</hi> with a few of his Diſciples; which may well commend unto you the love of retirement: And that brightneſs alſo wherewith he was cloathed, he commanded to be concealed as a great ſecret till a a fit ſeaſon to divulge it; which may well teach us to keep to our ſelves what paſſes between God and our ſouls, till others may be concerned in it as much as our ſelves. You may refer this perhaps to the Humility of his Spirit, but yet I thought good to adviſe you of it alone, becauſe it deſerves a particular conſideration. There is a vanity you may be guilty of if you heed not this, of glorying when you come abroad again, of the ſecret communication that you have had with <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the time of your Solitude. For I obſerve it is the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of ſome who profeſs acquaintance with Him, when they feel any delitious joyes exceeding the common ſort (which perhaps are indulged only in favour of their weakneſs and intended meerly to cheriſh their
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:101895:75"/>preſent childiſh condition) to blaze them every where and report them to others without any great occaſion for it. They think it a piece of Religion to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their experiences to the next paſſenger they meet withall: They love that others ſhould know how nobly they are treated: and ſo they lay a double ſnare, one for themſelves by the high conceit which they may raiſe in others of their excellencies; and a ſecond for their neighbours, by the diſcouragement they may feel for want of ſuch elevations. If your ſpirit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be at any time tranſported; if God ſhine into your heart very brightly and darken all this world in your eyes by cauſing his glory to cover you; I beſeech you caſt a cloud about it, that no body elſe may ſee it, unleſs the good of others make it neceſſary that it ſhould be revealed. Draw a vail over your face when it is ſo radiant, leaſt by ſhining too brightly upon others it hurt their eyes; and the reflection of it prove dangerous to your ſelf. As when you are in the World you muſt not forget to be private with God; ſo when you have been the moſt with God it is ſafeſt to keep it private from the World.</p>
               <p>It may be ſeaſonable here to add, that <hi>while He maintained this delightful Converſe with God for his own benefit, his life was moſt profitable to others.</hi> Prayer and Meditation did not hinder his labours; but they were ſpurrs to induſtry, and made him more careful to do his work for which he was ſent into the world. He was not only attent to his own ſpirit that it might be kept with God, but he watcht for advantages of bringing the hearts of others to him. Much leſs did he ſpend his time in pleaſing amuſements to think how much he was in the favour of Heaven; but he iſſued
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:101895:76"/>out of theſe delicious thoughts, and took as great a pleaſure in introducing others into the ſame favour. There was no hour paſſed, but he did ſome good or other to the world. The finiſhing of one undertaking, was but the paſſage to another. When he ceaſed to do any thing, it was only that he might begin again. The change of his labours ſerved him inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And to go to a new work was all the Reſt that he deſired. His greateſt pleaſure was to do a pleaſure to other men. He choſe rather to want his meat, than ſuffer them to want his help. The greater pain there was in any buſineſs, the more he delighted in it: and pleaſure could not win his love, but by means of the labour which did bring it forth. In which diligence it concerns you very highly to imitate him if you mean to aſſure your arrival at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The world is then to be feared, when it finds us empty and void of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. We are ſafe enough though we live in it, if we do not live in idleneſs. While we have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to do, we ſhall eaſily reſiſt it, and turn aſide the ſtrongeſt of its temptations. You muſt not be at leiſure to go about any thing that is bad. You muſt deprive vice of all means to approach you, and let it have no time wherein to make its aſſaults. Whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it attempts to enter, let it find that you are full and that there is no room at all for its entertainment. Let the ſolicitations of the fleſh ever come out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and know that you have not a moment but what is prae-ingaged to ſome other imployment. When any temptation deſires to ſpeak with you, let the anſwer be ready that there is other company within, and that you cannot attend it: and when it would violently draw you away, let it find you bound and held very faſt by ſomething elſe. Finally, be unwearied in well
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:101895:76"/>doing and allot every portion of your time to ſome honeſt uſe or other: So will the world deſpair of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you to her deſires, when it alwayes takes you other wayes buſied and perceives that all your hours are deſtin'd to other purpoſes. And truly if this were the conſtant end of our living, to do good or to receive it, it would prove the Bane of ſo many unprofitable thoughts when we are alone, and ſo many unprofitable words when we are with others; that we and the World would be very much amended by it.</p>
               <p>But now it is time to draw to an end of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and therefore I will only give you a ſhort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of this one thing more, <hi>That Jeſus was very ſtrong to reſiſt the temptations of the Devil in the midſt of his greateſt weakneſs, and had a great Faith and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God in the midſt of the greateſt dangers and moſt ſudden ſurpriſes.</hi> His long hunger was not ſo ſharp, as to provoke him to take any undue means for its ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. When his Diſciples awaked him in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of a tempeſt, his heart was not terrified nor his thoughts diſordered; but he gravely reproves the ſmallneſs of their Faith. He ever held Heaven faſt by the hand, and whatſoever it was that aſſayed to ſhake his conſtancy; he ſtood firm, and would not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo much as to doubt of the preſence and power of God with him. Be you ſure to have this Faith and powerful confidence of his alwaies in your eye: for you muſt not expect (as I ſhall ſhortly tell you) to paſs to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> without many conflicts. When you are moſt infirm, your enemies will moſt ſtrongly aſſault you, and ſtrive to hale and draw you another way. Your afflictions will give them reſolution, and in the time of your languiſhments they will take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:101895:77"/>the greateſt courage. Whatſoever other weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs therefore you labour under, be ſure you be not weak in Faith: and when all other ſupports in the world fail you, remember to cleave and adhere cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto God. Keep awake a ſenſe of his preſence with you, by often thoughts of him; thruſt your ſelf into his arms continually by a firm truſt in him; be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, by taking hold of his Almighty Goodneſs. And then let your Adverſaries be what they will, whether from within, or from without; let their Armies be never ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous which are ſet in battel againſt you: Doubt not but through an holy confidence in God, and the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayer of Faith for the aids of his Spirit; they ſhall all diſband and flye away like ſo many heaps of duſt before the wind, and yield you the victory which they promiſed to themſelves. In this aſſurance I think it is beſt to ſeal up the ſecrets of that ſentence which I have been ſo long diſcloſing to you. For, though there are many other things remarkable in <hi>Jeſus</hi> (as you will ſee if you frequently faſten your eyes upon him) yet if I ſhould enumerate them all, I muſt turn over the leaves of the whole Goſpel and unfold them to you. The particulars alſo that I have mentioned, are ſufficient to give you ſuch a taſte of him, that if you like them, you cannot but delight to ſeek out all the reſt your ſelf; and therefore I ſhall not deprive you of that pleaſure, preſuming that you are not inſenſible from what hath been ſaid, that there is no greater than to know and follow <hi>Jeſus.</hi>

               <head type="sub">Of Faith in <hi>Jeſus.</hi> How imperfectly, or obſcurely it is commonly expreſſed, to the great danger of Chriſtian Pilgrims. What the true notion of it is, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deceive us.</head>
               <p>AND truly herein he was not miſtaken, for though he ſpoke theſe laſt words with an accent very ſharp, yet the Pilgrim hath often ſince ſaid, that he thought his heart made a ſhriller Eccho, and bade him, <hi>Follow Jeſus.</hi> It is not in the compaſs of my power to relate the contentment which the poor man took in this diſcourſe. He felt rather an exceſſive joy, than a bare ſatisfaction, which gave many indications of it ſelf, though it could not be expreſſed. But the firſt words, as I remember, which he uttered, when the other made a little ſtop, was this vehement exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Oh Sir, how happily have you undeceived me! I have thought ſometimes, that the way to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> lay moſt of all through Churches; and that a Pilgrim had little elſe to do but only to hear Sermons very oft, and read good Books, and make many prayers; and that in theſe the very life of Religion did conſiſt. Nay, I have been perſwaded to think that he had no other task but only to <hi>Believe on Jeſus,</hi> and that he would take care to carry him to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But thanks be to God and you, I have now heard another leſſon, which I will ſtudy to learn my whole life. I find my ſelf already ſo much in love with <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that I believe I ſhall carefully mark every ſtep of his holy feet, of which he hath left us any print; and indeavour to tread
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:101895:78"/>in them, following of him with as much exactneſs as I am able. He would have added a great many more proteſtations of his hearty intentions, but that the Guide thought it fit to lay hold on this occaſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him a little further about thoſe things wherein he had been ſo groſly abuſed. Having let him know therefore that he was no leſs pleaſed than himſelf to ſee ſo ſudden a fruit of his labours, he proceeded to tell him that he had taught him nothing new in all his diſcourſe, nor ſpoke one ſyllable but what was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in thoſe few words, if rightly underſtood, <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus.</hi> For, though Faith in Chriſt hath ſometimes a reſtrained ſenſe importing our truſt in him for help and ſuccour; yet when it ſtands alone by it ſelf, it hath a more comprehenſive meaning. It is ſo far from denoting ſuch a part of Religion as thoſe now mentioned, that it frequently compriſes the whole; and it muſt alwaies be conceived ſuch a part, as neceſſarily implies and inferrs all the reſt. I ſpeak now of the <hi>Pilgrims Faith,</hi> which you muſt carry along with you. Of which, whoſoever gives you any other deſcription than ſuch as this doth but deceive you, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is ſuch an hearty perſwaſion of the truth and goodneſs of Gods Promiſes, and of every thing elſe that he hath ſpoken, as makes us obedient in all things to his commands. There is nothing more viſible than this in the very firſt man of the Order into which you are entring: <hi>Abraham</hi> I mean, the moſt ancient <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim</hi> that I read of, and the Father of faithful Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. Who being commanded by God to leave his own Country, his Kindred, and his Fathers houſe, moſt readily obeyed; in a perſwaſion that God would be as good as his word, and bleſs him with poſſeſſions ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where elſe. He was the man whom God <hi>called to his
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:101895:78"/>foot,</hi> and who marched whitherſoever he would lead him: in reſemblance to whom all his children are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Chriſtian Church, as thoſe <hi>who follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goes.</hi> Conformity to <hi>Jeſus</hi> is abſolutely neceſſary to make us ſuch believers as ſhall inherit the promiſes. Though the general notion of <hi>Faith</hi> do not include obedience (being only our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of, and aſſent unto the truth of what is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to us upon the teſtimony of God) yet ſaving Faith, that Faith which will carry us to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> can never be underſtood without it. All the definitions you meet with, whatſoever they be, which ſeparate obedience from this Faith, I do confidently aſſure you are but a meer cheat, and a dangerous illuſion. Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is ſo much of the nature of the <hi>Pilgrims Faith,</hi> that I ſay it again, it ought to enter its Definition. Which is as much as to ſay, that one cannot ſpeak in any terms or phraſes which are not deceitful and liable to be abuſed, of that Faith which will bring us ſafe to Heaven; but he muſt make mention of the obedience it produces to the commands of our Saviour. This is the very thing that diſtinguiſhes ſaving Faith from that which is not ſaving, and therefore if this be left out when we ſpeak of it, we may make men Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites ſooner than ſincere Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>But if I may be ſo bold, as to interpoſe a Queſtion (ſaid the Learner) I pray ſatisfie me why you call this the <hi>Pilgrims Faith:</hi> is there any elſe beſides? There is, replyed his Teacher; we meet in this world with a Faith more gallant, fine and delicate, than the plain and homely belief which I have deſcribed. A <hi>modiſh and courtly Faith</hi> it is, which ſits ſtill, and yet ſets you in the lap of Chriſt. It paſſes under ſo many names,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:101895:79"/>that I cannot ſtand to number them all now. It is called a caſting of our ſelves upon Chriſt, a relying on his merits, a ſhrouding our ſelves under the robes of his Righteouſneſs: and though ſometimes it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a going to him for Salvation; yet there is this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in the buſineſs, that you may go, and yet not go; you may go, and yet ſtand ſtill; you may caſt your ſelf upon him, and not come to him; or if you take one little ſtep, and be at the pains to come to him, the work is done, and you need not follow him. It is indeed a reſting, not a travelling Grace. And ſuch a grand ſecret there is in it, that a man may reſt before he ſtir a foot; he may lean on Chriſt, and approach no nearer him than he was before; he may lay hold on him, and yet remain at the greateſt diſtance from him. It will carry you to the end of your way, before you are at the beginning: The very firſt ſtep of it, is to ſtay your ſelf: the beginning of its motion, is to be at reſt. Do you not ſee a ſtrange inchantment in it already? Is it not a magical operation, or much beholden to ſtrength of fancy, and the witchcraft of imagination? For my part I ſhould take my ſelf to be in a far worſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than <hi>Creſinius</hi> was, if I ſhould be accuſed of vend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch druggs and dealing in ſuch dangerous charms. I would grant my enemies had cauſe to exclaim, and ſhould never expect to clear my ſelf, if I ſtood charged with ſuch incantations. There is no jugling ſo arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, whereby I could hope to hide the deceit if I abuſed the world with theſe impoſtures. My own conſcience, I mean, would indict me, and pronounce my condemnation, though I think, if the greateſt part of the men among us, were to be Judges, I need not fear their ſentence againſt me. For the charm, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, is ſo powerful, and the faſcination of ſuch plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:101895:79"/>that the numbers are not to be told which are bewitched with it. The multitude goes in crouds in this wide rode: the voice of the people cryes up this as the only way to Heaven. All the lewd men in the world are well contented to take this journey, which may be finiſhed at one ſtep; and to run this race which may be accompliſhed in a breath, and for which the laſt breath in their body may as well ſerve as any elſe. There is no man but he takes hold of Chriſt, and having heard that this is Faith; do what you can, it is not poſſible to beat off his hands. There is not a ſoul ſo wicked, but it applies to it ſelf his righteouſneſs, and fancies all its ſins to be covered therewith. It is the ſweeteſt thing in the world to caſt themſelves into his arms, and expect not to go, but to be carried to Heaven. They reſt on him and him only for Salvation. They reſt on him ſo ſolely for it, that they are loath to ſtir a foot to contribute any thing toward it. They would have him to take all the honour of the buſineſs to himſelf: and are deſirous to do not ſo much as one good action; but leave him to do all, and impute his doings to them. Thus they imagine themſelves to be the only advancers of <hi>Free Grace:</hi> and they think there are none but they that ſet the Crown upon Chriſt's head. Such an admirable ſubtilty there is in this Faith, that they can ſerve their own intereſt by it, and yet ſeem all the while to be the beſt ſervants of Chriſt. They can promote their own deſires, and yet ſound aloud his Glory. They can invade his rights as much as they liſt, and yet be thought the only perſons that make it their care he ſhould not be wronged.</p>
               <p>Nay, it makes men think that God is beholden to them, for being ſo cautious as to give him nothing.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:101895:80"/>He ſhould not be ſo much obliged, if they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to become better. The only qualification that they know of for his favours, is not to be qualified at all to receive them. He owes, it ſeems, much of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their want of virtue. If they ſhould give him more than they do, he would have leſs. To bring any thing to him, would be to rob him, and take away from him. His Grace would loſe its name, if they ſhould ſtudy to attain it. They ſhould detract very much from the freeneſs of it, if they ſhould provide for any thing but only to receive it. It would not be ſo rich if they were not poor and beggarly in all good works. His Honour relyes very much upon their weakneſs, and his Glory is ſupported by their imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillity. To be much in debt to him, is the beſt pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that can be made him. To win his love, it is beſt to be men of no deſert. And to be out of all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of truſting to their own righteouſneſs; they judge it the ſureſt courſe to have none at all.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the men who make the Grace of God ſo <hi>free,</hi> that he leaves nothing for himſelf. The riches of it is ſo abundant towards them, that he gives away all his own right. He makes ſuch liberal grants to theſe favourites, that there remains nothing as a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to him. He takes ſuch a great care of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that he forgets his own. And loves to let them have their will ſo much, that he ſuffers his own to be croſſed for their ſake. It is not He, it ſhould ſeem, but they that rule the world. His will bends to their deſires: and ſince they have no mind to be be good; they have invented a way that he may love them, though they continue bad. He ſees them not (as they fancy) in themſelves, but in a diſguiſe. They
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:101895:80"/>do not appear in their own colours, but in anothers dreſs. He doth not behold them naked, but cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Robes of Chriſt. And though they have a world of ſins, yet they think to have them hid, while he looks upon their garments, and not upon them. And indeed ſo free is this Grace, that he can have no title to their obedience, but only their own gratitude. He holds his Kingdom and Authority, only by their good will. If they do what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, it is their kindneſs, and more than they owe him. Since Chriſt's obedience is perſonally imputed to them, he cannot in juſtice require any at their hands. Since he hath performed the Law in their ſtead, and made his righteouſneſs immediately theirs; he cannot expect that they ſhould perform it too, nor exact any righteouſneſs of their own. For this would be to demand the ſame debt twice; and to call for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a bond, which hath been already ſatisfied. In fine; He can claim nothing as his due, but muſt be content with that which they will give him: and it is thought the ſafeſt way to give him little or nothing, leſt they ſhould at all abate of the freeneſs of what he he is to give.</p>
               <p>I hope your ſoul will never enter into this ſecret, nor follow the rabble in theſe groundleſs fancies. But you will rather put to your hands to pull down that Idol of Faith, which hath been ſet up with ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and Religiouſly worſhipped ſo long among us: That dead Image of Faith which ſo many have adored, truſted in and periſhed. I mean the notion which hath been ſo zealouſly advanced, how that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving is nothing elſe, but a <hi>relying</hi> on <hi>Jeſus</hi> for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>a fiducial recumbency upon him; a caſting our
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:101895:81"/>ſelves wholly upon him and his merits; or an applying of his righteouſneſs to our ſouls.</hi> And if you throw all thoſe other phraſes after them, which tell us that it is a <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> of Chriſt, a <hi>laying hold</hi> of him, a <hi>cloſing</hi> with him, or an <hi>embracing</hi> of him; you ſhall do the better, and more certainly ſecure your ſelf from being deceived.</p>
               <p>For as to theſe latter expreſſions is it not viſible at the firſt naming of them, that they are obſcure, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and metaphorical words? Is it not as hard to know what it is to <hi>take</hi> him, and to <hi>cloſe</hi> with him, as it is to underſtand what it is to <hi>Believe?</hi> Whatſoever then you have been told of me, I doubt not but you will ſind that I direct you in a plain and honeſt path; it being indeed againſt my nature to like any thing which is intricate, perplexed, and ſo myſterious, that a ſimple man cannot comprehend it. Who is there that doth not underſtand me when I ſay, that to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is <hi>ſo heartily to give your aſſent to the truth of the Goſpel, that you live according to it?</hi> What word is there of all theſe, that hath a doubtful meaning? or if ten thouſand men ſhould hear them, what poſſibility is there that among them all there ſhould be found ſo much as one different ſenſe about them? whereas thoſe words, To take Chriſt, to embrace him and cloſe with him, are of ſuch dubious ſignification, that both the act and the object (as we uſually ſpeak) have an ambiguous meaning. There are ſeveral wayes of taking, and embracing: and by <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſometimes meant his perſon, and ſometimes his Goſpel or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Now if to <hi>Take,</hi> be with our mind and heart to allow, approve, aſſent to any thing; then to take <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the firſt ſenſe of that word, is to acknowledge him for the Son of God; the promiſed ſeed which he
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:101895:81"/>ſaid ſhould be ſent into the World: And to <hi>take</hi> him in the other, is nothing elſe, but that which I told you; To aſſent in ſuch manner to all that is ſaid of him, or he hath ſaid in the Goſpel, that we become obedient to his word. To what purpoſe then is it to uſe theſe phraſes, when there are better at hand whereby we muſt explain them? Since this muſt be ſaid which I have told you, why cannot it be ſaid at firſt? When things can be clearly expreſſed, why ſhould we chuſe to ſpeak them darkly? eſpecially ſince there can be no fruit of it but only this, that men are longer before they underſtand us; and perhaps at the firſt hearing of what we ſpeak obſcurely, their minds are impreſſed with ſome ſuch dangerous ſenſe which they form to themſelves; that all our explications cannot blot it out. It is of great moment, what mens ſouls are firſt imprinted withall. They will retain thoſe words; and perchance think good to make the expoſition ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own fancy. Why ſhould not our words therefore carry their interpretation in them? or what ſhould make us love to talk in ſuch terms, that we cannot be certainly apprehended unleſs we talk a great deal more?</p>
               <p>Of that ſaid the Traveller (who was deſirous to know all he could in this matter) I would willingly be informed by your ſelf. You would oblige me very much if you could think fit to reſolve your own que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. For truly I love ſo dearly to underſtand what I hear (as thanks be to God I do what you ſay) that I wonder any men ſhould go to ſeek for hard words, when thoſe that are plain do thruſt themſelves into their mouths.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:101895:82"/>
               <p>I meant not replyed the Guide to draw my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to this inquiry, but only to expreſs to you by thoſe queſtions the unreaſonableneſs of ſuch mens pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. Yet ſince it is your deſire and I am not willing to deny you any thing; you ſhall know what I conceive in this matter, provided you will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that anſwer which lyes uppermoſt in my thoughts, and offers it ſelf firſt to my mind.</p>
               <p>They are not in love I am apt to think with ſuch a definition of <hi>Faith</hi> as I have given you, becauſe it is Pilgrim-like, plain as a Pike-ſtaff. It is in this caſe as in many other: there are a company of men in the world who deſpiſe any thing which they underſtand eaſily, and imagine there is no great matter in it, if it be preſently intelligible. They admire that moſt which they do not comprehend; and conceive there is ſome myſtery and depth in it, if it be difficult to be explained. Juſt as you ſee abundance of men affect hard words, nay bombaſtick language and a fuſtian kind of dialect; though there be no greater eloquence then to ſpeak naturally and with facility of expreſſion: So there are as many, who love things obſcurely delivered and which have a cloud about them; though it be the perfection of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, to render our conceptions clear and eaſie to enter into the moſt vulgar capacities. As they think him an Orator who mounts and ſoars aloft (as they call it) in high-flown words; ſo they take him for a deep Divine whoſe notions of things are ſo expreſſed as they cannot preſently ſound and dive to the bottom of them. Hence it is that they contemn ſuch a familiar, plain and facile explication of the word <hi>Faith,</hi> as doth not intricate a man's conceptions, but can at firſt ſight
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:101895:82"/>be apprehended; and they had rather have you ſpeak of it in Metaphorical or borrowed words, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing more properly to other things then they do to this; make an uncertain ſound, and leave the mind in confuſion. If you ſay that it is a Taking of Chriſt, of whole Chriſt; an applying of what he hath done, to the ſoul; a cleaving to him, or in ſuch like words expreſs your ſelf: all theſe ſeem to have more of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery and Goſpel-ſecrets in them, then the poor Pilgrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe hath; and ſo they win more credit with thoſe men who are not wont to like any thing which every child may underſtand as well as themſelves. Beſides it muſt be confeſſed, that ſuch words as thoſe do not touch the bottom of the heart, nor ſo inſtantly pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate to the very quick as the other plainly do, and ſo they muſt needs be better accepted in the world. They do not ſo neceſſarily and clearly imply mens obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to our Lord, which in this that I mention is in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect terms expreſſed; and ſo they will be ſure to meet with kinder welcome and entertainment.</p>
               <p>He was proceeding to add ſome other words much to the ſame effect when the Pilgrim begging his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for diverting him from his main diſcourſe, told him that he was too much ſatisfied in the truth of what he ſaid and deſired to hear no more of this folly of mankind. But what think you (added he) of thoſe other deſcriptions of Faith which tell us that it is <hi>A relying upon our Saviour?</hi> cannot every body under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this language as well as that which you ſpeak? I grant it, anſwered the Director; but if it be not ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the firſt defect which I objected, it is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly guilty of the laſt and worſt: for there is in it nothing of our obedience. As the former were faulty
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:101895:83"/>in regard of their obſcurity, ſo this is manifeſtly chargable with lameneſs and imperfection. You ſhall be convinced of the truth of this imputation in a very few words. For <hi>firſt,</hi> the moſt that can be made of this relyance on Chriſt for Salvation is, that it is one act of Faith, but there wants a great number more to make up an intire body of Chriſtian belief. And, <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> as it is but one ſingle act, ſo it is far from being the firſt, but muſt ſuppoſe many others that go before it. As for example, it is neceſſary we be perſwaded that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt of God,</hi> that what he hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Goſpel is his will, and that if we hope for ſalvation by him we muſt be conformed in all things to this will of God. And then <hi>thirdly</hi> theſe perſwaſions or acts of Faith that thus precede, muſt produce a ſincere and cordial obedience to his laws, before we can reaſonably arrive at this confidence of relying upon him for ſalvation. Now why this particular act of Faith ſhould be alone mentioned in the definition of it, which is but one and not the firſt, nor chiefe, and all the reſt left out; is paſt my capacity to underſtand. When our Faith hath rendered us obedient to him, then we may take the boldneſs to perſwade our ſelves that he will ſave us: and this is nothing but an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his command alſo, who hath bid us truſt him and take his word that he will be the Saviour of all faithful perſons. But it is a preſumption to do it ſooner, and the ready courſe to deſtroy the Religion of Chriſt to advance ſuch an haſty and forward belief in mens ſouls.</p>
               <p>And therefore let me beſeech you as you love your ſoul to be a follower of faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> who (as I told you) was the founder of your Order. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:101895:83"/>that ſuch as he was, ſuch muſt you be if you hope to come to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and inherit the land of promiſe: and that in his example you meet with nothing earlier then this, that <hi>by Faith, when he was called to go out into a place which he ſhould after receive for an inheritance, he obeyed, and went out, not knowing whither he went.</hi> This was the firſt thing wherein his Faith imployed it ſelf, and the laſt was like unto it: For when he was tryed by God he offered up his only begotten Son who was to be the heir of that inheritance which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to him. From this active Faith no doubt it is that He and all good Chriſtians are called <hi>Faithful</hi> and not from a lazy recumbency on Chriſt for Salvation; or the ſtrongeſt application of his merits to their ſouls. If theſe were ſufficient to make a perſon of that deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; then we need no better character of a <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervant</hi> or <hi>ſteward</hi> (which the holy writings ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mention) then ſuch an one as follows. He is a perſon that relyes upon his Maſters merits; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends only on the worth and ſufficiency of his Lord. He truſts in his goodneſs for a pardon of all his faults, and hopes he will eſteem him a good ſervant becauſe he is a good Maſter. He leans upon his arm, and claſps faſt about him, and is reſolved not to let him go till he have paid him his wages. He embraces him kindly, and hopes he will account him righteous becauſe he is ſo himſelf. And in one word, He applyes to himſelf all the good works that his Maſter hath performed; and prayes to be excuſed if he do not his buſineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that his Lord can do it better. Is not this a very ridiculous deſcription? or would you be content to be thus ſerved? Do not imagine then that God will be ſerved after this faſhion; or that ſuch an ill-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured notion as this, is the beſt that can be found to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:101895:84"/>compoſe the definition of a true believer. But firſt do all that you can, and then acknowledge your ſelf an unprofitable ſervant. Let it be your care to follow your work, and then rely only upon the goodneſs of our Lord to give you a reward. Be ſure that you be inwardly righteous, and then no doubt the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt will procure you acceptance, and bring you to that happineſs which you can no wayes deſerve.</p>

               <head type="sub">What place <hi>Prayer, Hearing</hi> of Sermons, <hi>Reading</hi> of Good Books, <hi>Receiving</hi> the Sacrament; have in the Religion of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> And of what uſe they are to Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims.</head>
               <p>AND that you may be able to make a better judgement of what I have ſaid, and I may alſo return to the occaſion and beginning of this diſcourſe, let me intreat you to conſider well the nature and ends of <hi>Prayer</hi> to God. It is manifeſt from the life of <hi>Jeſus</hi> that it is but a part of that duty and obedience that we owe to God, and yet it is a powerful means to bring us to all the reſt. It is the converting and turning about of our minds and hearts to the original of our Being. It is our reflecting and looking back upon him from whom we came. It is our circling and winding about (as Heathens themſelves have well conceived) to that point from which we took our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, that we may be faſt united to God and never be divided from him. It is an acknowledgement of God in all his perfections: An expreſſion of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance and ſubjection: an oblation of our ſelves,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:101895:84"/>both ſoul and body to him. Think therefore to what purpoſes it moſt naturally ſerves: for it being a thing of daily uſe, you may judge thereby what the great buſineſs of Chriſtianity or Believing is. Doth it mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter chiefly to our confidence of being ſaved; and are we to ſwell our ſelves by this breath with great hopes that we are beloved of God? Or rather is it not moſt properly ſubſervient to the putting of us into a ſtate of Salvation, and the rendring us fit objects of the Divine Love. It is not intended to inſpire us with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits that we are the children of God, but to breathe into us the ſpirit of ſons, and to impreſs upon us the image of him upon whom we fix our eyes. It is the elevation of our minds to him, and the faſtning of our eyes upon him, in order to our being made more like him. It is the oblation of our ſelves to his uſes and ſervice, and not a giving of our ſelves to be ſaved by him. Here we place our minds in the brightneſs of his heavenly light. Here we expoſe our cold affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the warmth and heat of the Sun of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. We behold our Lord moſt clearly in theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Meditations; and by the frequency of them, we ſhall learn his carriage and geſtures, and conform all our actions to the excellent model of his. I beſeech you deſcend into your own heart and if you know what it is to pray, tell me what <hi>Faith</hi> it is which you feel then moſt ſtirring in your heart. Is it only a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyance on Chriſt, and an application of his merits to your ſoul? Or is it not rather a vigorous application of your mind to him, that you may feel him more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting and promoting his life in your heart? Is it not a ſtrong deſire to be touched by him, to be impreſſed with his likeneſs, to be joyned to him and made one ſpirit with him; and in one word, that you may be
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:101895:85"/>made more ready and diſpoſed to every good work? I will evidently convince you that this is the great end of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and conſequently, the main work of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on the Son of God.</p>
               <p>We are, you know, of kin to two Worlds, and placed in the middle between Heaven and Earth. With our Heads we touch the one, and with our Feet we ſtand upon the other. Man is the common term wherein theſe two meet and are combined. By his ſuperiour faculties he holds communion with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſpiritual world, and by his lower he feels the outward and corporeal. But there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the correſpondence which we hold with one, and that which we maintain with the other. For to this ſenſible World we lye open &amp; bare, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and the inviſible World there is a groſs cloud and vail of fleſh which interpoſes. Or to ſpeak more plainly; Our ſenſes have nothing that comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and their objects to hinder their free ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to them; whereas our underſtanding hath thoſe very objects wherewith they are prepoſſeſſed, to interrupt the light of coeleſtial things which ſhine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. The outward man is continually expoſed to the ſtrokes of the things of this outward World, and without any difficulty or pains is moved by them: but our Mind is not ſo patent to the things of the other, nor is our Will ſo eaſily inclined by them. For they being already impreſſed and engaged by ſenſible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, theſe lye between us and the higher Regions; and they having enjoyed a long familiarity with them before we received notice of any thing elſe beſide; it will require ſome labour to bring us and thoſe Nobler objects together. In ſhort, the ſenſes have nothing elſe
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:101895:85"/>to do, but only to receive thoſe things which preſent themſelves before them, nor are they ſolicited by any other enjoyments: But our minds and wills are haled two waies, and ſolicited by this World as well as by the other; ſo that to perceive that which is Divine we muſt remove this out of the way, and pull our ſouls from thoſe thoughts and deſires wherein theſe lower things have intangled our hearts. Unleſs our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding draw her ſelf aſide to the contemplation of Divine Truths, and thereby carry the Will to the taſte of an higher Good, it cannot be avoided but that we become meer men of this World, and by being wholly carnal, loſe our acquaintance with the other caeleſtial Country. We ſhall be altogether fraught with fleſhly opinions and affections, and have nothing remaining in us of a ſpiritual ſenſe. This therefore breeds an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity of conſtant holy <hi>Meditation,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout <hi>Prayers.</hi> By the one of which our mind being abſtracted from, and elevated beyond the things of corporeal ſenſe, is brought to a converſe and familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with heavenly notions: and by the other our Will is poſſeſſed with ſpiritual inclinations; nay, raviſhed into the embraces of a Divine Good. <hi>Meditation</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes our Underſtanding with right opinions, and noble thoughts: and <hi>Prayer</hi> carries our Will to the love of them, and joyns our affections faſt unto them. By the one we are tyed in our mind, and by the other in our choice to the better World. This, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, is the natural and true uſe of theſe devout exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes: to diſpoſe our ſouls by drawing them away from theſe inferiour enjoyments, to receive communications from above, and to be made partakers of a Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. There is no queſtion to be made of it, that God loves to impart himſelf to rational Beings. But
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:101895:86"/>in what manner, I beſeech you, can he do it, unleſs it be by our Underſtandings and Wills rightly diſpoſed? And what other end therefore can theſe <hi>two</hi> have which put us in a fit diſpoſition and capacity for him; than to bring us to that true knowledge and love of him, whereby we partake of his nature. In theſe you muſt employ your ſelf, and they are to be thought more neceſſary than any other buſineſs; but yet you ſee they are but the means and way to a Divine State, and have ſomething beyond themſelves which they are to effect: and that is the bringing of us to the life of the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Prayer be not thus deſigned, and do not produce ſuch fruit, it is ſo far from procuring us acceptance with God (though it be top full of that <hi>Faith</hi> which relyes upon Chriſt) that it proves a thing very fulſome and diſpleaſing unto him. It is a meer noiſe and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in his ears, than which there cannot be any thing more troubleſome and offenſive. He loves not to be diſturbed with ſuch ſounds as have nothing in them, but flattery and nauſeous commendations of him. He cares not for being extolled by ſuch unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed mouths. It is a great injury to him to be praiſed and magnified by evil doers. He hates the pretences of their Friendſhip, and loathes the complements which they load him withall. He cannot indure to have his Courts filled with theſe impudent people; leſt he ſhould be thought ſuch an one as themſelves. As the Sacrifices of old were eſteemed no better than Murders, and all the offerings but ſo many butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which were committed, when they left themſelves behind, and brought not their hearts and affections to be offered up to God: So are all mens confident
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:101895:86"/>Prayers and Devotions now, no better than propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of his Name, and a kind of blaſphemy, or evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaking of him; while they are enemies to the Life of God, and deſpiſers of good works. They do moſt baſely reproach him in the world, by taking upon them the title of his greateſt Favourites. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to ſcorn, by appropriating to themſelves the name of his ſervants. There cannot be a greater wrong to him, than to make men believe, that he is a lover of ſuch filthy Hypocrites. You have obſerved, no doubt, that the Sacrifices in ancient times were called the <hi>Meat of God,</hi> and the <hi>Food</hi> or proviſion that was made for his Houſe. And yet in the company of evil works they are ſaid to be an Abomination to him; and he profeſſes that he had as lief they had brought him a Dog, as offer a Lamb, and that a Swine would have been as acceptable as the fatteſt of their Bullocks. He proteſts that his ſoul abhorred their New Moons, and ſolemn Aſſemblies: that their Incenſe was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury ſtink, and that the Fat and Blood of their Beaſts, were no better than their Dung and Ordure. He bids them bring him no more vain oblations. He ſaith, that he was full of them, and nauſeated the Table that they ſpread for him. And in plain terms he lets them know that it was to no purpoſe to multiply their Prayers, for he could not hear them. And ſo truly may you aſſure your ſelf, that though pious Prayers are now moſt prevalent and forcible with him, yet the grunting of Swine, or the howling of Wolves are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as welcome; as the clamorous petitions of thoſe who ſue for his Love, without any thorow amendment of their lives. He deteſts thoſe bawling worſhippers, who intend nothing elſe but to drown the cry of their ſins, and to make him deaf to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:101895:87"/>which their iniquity brings againſt them. Their breath is an unwholeſome and infectious vapour, which poiſons the World, and is the Peſt of Religion. Their meetings and aſſemblies are ſo many conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies againſt the Authority and Life of God. Their words do but wound his ears, and their loud cryes are but ſo many aſſaults and batteries againſt Heaven. He hates to ſee thoſe hands lifted up unto him, which will inſtantly be lifted up againſt him. He cannot indure they ſhould lay hold on him, and eſteems ſuch rude attempts to be the committing of a rape upon his mercy, and an indeavour to force his favour. He hath opened no way for ſuch bold acceſs unto him. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended to incourage ſuch impudence. Their zeal is a ſtrange fire which kindles another in Heaven againſt them. And notwithſtanding all their fawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon him, the Dogs which follow them to the place of their aſſemblies, ſhall as ſoon be accepted as themſelves. And therefore be ſure to make your Prayers touch your own heart before you expect they ſhould reach Heaven. Let them work upon your ſelf, before you aſſume a conſidence that they will have the deſired effect upon God.</p>
               <p>And now I have little to ſay concerning the <hi>hearing</hi> of Sermons, <hi>reading</hi> of the Bible, and other good Books (which you ſay there are many think do compoſe the whole of a Religious life) for it is plain enough they can have no other end than to furniſh your mind with pious Meditations, and diſpoſe your will to Prayer, and all other holy duties. You cannot well think that theſe have any other place in the godly life, than that of Inſtruments and Helps whereby to arrive at it. And it is very eaſie to know from what hath been diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:101895:87"/>what <hi>Sermons</hi> are moſt to be regarded. Not thoſe which give your fancy a pleaſure, and tickle your imagination: but thoſe which powerfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten your underſtanding, and move your will to the choice of that which is right and Good. There are too many of thoſe frivolous Hearers, who are more pleaſed with little gingles, and the tinkling of words, than with the moſt perſwaſive arguments which the moſt piercing reaſon in the world can urge upon their hearts. But their puniſhment is heavy enough for this levity; they being condemned for ever to be fools or children, whoſe minds are inchanted with the Rhiming of words, or with their countermarching and the ringing of changes upon them, or other ſuch like adulterate Ware, which would fain paſs for wit and elegance. Next to the love of Gibberiſh, and of canting phraſes, there is no greater dotage than this, of courting the diſeaſes, corruptions, and the rotten carkaſe of eloquence, and ſleighting the life and ſpirit of it. One would wonder that reaſonable ſouls ſhould delight in toying and playing with letters and ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables. There is nothing more ſtrange unleſs it be this; that there are a company of men to be found who are at a great deal of pains to trim themſelves with theſe tinſel ornaments, and with much curioſity ſtudy to ſpeak abſurdly. It is not their negligence, but they take a care to trifle. They do not ſlip unawares into childiſh expreſſions, but they fall into them by deſign.</p>
               <p>But if you would be wiſe and good, you muſt open your ears to plain words, and ſtrong ſenſe, to proper and ſignificant language, which brings along with it powerful and convincing arguments; to that which ſtrikes and penetrates into the ſoul, and doth not
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:101895:88"/>meerly glide ſmoothly over the ſurface of it. You muſt not come to be tickled, but to be taught; not to be pleaſed, but to be made better; not that a man may ſpeak to your guſt, but to your neceſſities. You muſt not think you have ſpent your time well when the Truth peeps into your ſoul, but ſtops at the door; or when your will is ſleightly moved, and then ſtands ſtill: but when the light pierces into your mind, and makes a broad day there; when a ſecret fire creeps into your veins; and continues to burn in your heart; when all your affections are carried away, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the poſſeſſion of Truth.</p>
               <p>And for this purpoſe you muſt read the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures themſelves, not to ſtore your mind with high notions, or to repleniſh it with a large furniture, and matter of diſcourſe, or to find ſupport for ſome of your opinions; but to get a ſtock of efficacious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for well doing, and to over-power your heart by the force of them to conſent unto it.</p>
               <p>And let this be your Rule alſo in reading other pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Books: For there are too many who regard only the lighteſt things in any diſcourſe: the fringes, the lace, and other ornaments, more than they do the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it ſelf. They note the pretty ſtories, the apt ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes, and here and there a ſmall ſentence which ſmites their fancy; but mind not the clear reaſons, the nervous arguments, and much leſs the whole ſcope and deſign of the treatiſe which they read. Much like ſome Writers we have ſeen, who reporting the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their times; take notice of little more than of Juſtings and Tornaments, of Bear-baitings, and lanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ships, and ſuch like frivolous matters which are
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:101895:88"/>of no moment. Or like thoſe Beggars, who travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling many Countries, behold a great number of fair buildings: but know nothing either of the perſons or the furniture, or the order and regular form which is to be obſerved in them.</p>
               <p>I think it is not amiſs to add that this likewiſe is the end you ought to propound to your ſelf in all your conferences with wiſe and pious ſouls, who may give you great aſſiſtance in your journey to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Not to breed in your ſelf an opinion that you are Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becauſe you frequent their company; but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive greater illumination of mind from their Torches, and to have your heart warmed with a greater love to God at their holy Fires.</p>
               <p>And here it will be ſeaſonable at the concluſion of this diſcourſe, to admoniſh you of a thing which may do you very much ſervice, and ſave you abundance of trouble which elſe may ariſe in your mind. There are many things, as you ſee, that will further you in well doing, <hi>viz. Prayer, Reading</hi> and <hi>Hearing</hi> the Word of God; <hi>Meditation, Conference</hi> with good men, and ſuch like; ſome of theſe, you muſt underſtand, will ſerve your purpoſe at one time, and ſome at another, according as you are diſpoſed, and they ſhall be found efficacious for the end to which they are deſigned. There is a great variety alſo in theſe, of which you may make an advantage, if you chuſe that uſe and practice of them which you ſhall find to have moſt power in it at the preſent, to withdraw your mind from worldly vanities, to mortifie your paſſions, and to eſtabliſh your will in the Love of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> As for inſtance; ſometimes it will be fit for you to <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:101895:89"/>and ſometimes to <hi>Pray,</hi> and ſometimes to <hi>Converſe</hi> with your friends: and it is not ſo much to be aſkt, which of theſe you ſhall chuſe, as which of them will beſt at that inſtant advance you in your way, and move your will with the greateſt force to virtuous actions. And then in Meditation, there is the Life of Chriſt and his Death; his Reſurrection and his Glory; his Coming again to Judgment, and the Life of the World to come; the long Experience you have had of his Goodneſs; the Inſtances which he daily gives of his Providence; the Example of all his Saints; and an hundred things beſides to exerciſe your thoughts; and have a great virtue in them to make you do your duty toward God and Man. In like manner there are ſundry Books, in the reading of which you may imploy your time (though I would rather have you chuſe the beſt, than a multitude) and ſeveral waies of praying and addreſſing your Petitions to God, which may every one of them have their places and ſeaſons according as you ſhall be diſpoſed to ſerve your ſoul of them. And therefore if you perceive that ſome of them through cuſtom and long uſe do in time loſe their Savour and their Power to increaſe the Love of God in you, and it ſeems to you there may be more profit in another way; take that new courſe, and leave the former without any ſcruple. For that <hi>Meditation</hi> which will not now affect you, at another time will prove more efficacious than any elſe; and that way of opening your ſoul to God, which now you forſake, will come about again to be in uſe. Only of this you muſt take a great care, to ſtir up your ſelf to a continual attendance upon the Publick Service of God. For that is a neceſſary acknowledgment of his Supreme Authority and Dominion in the World: and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:101895:89"/>though you feel your ſelf indiſpoſed, dull and heavy at certain times in theſe addreſſes, yet there is this good alwayes done; that by your very preſence there you have paid part of your homage to him, have own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be your Lord and Governour, and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that he is worthy of all Honour and Service. But, as for the reſt, though the inclination and reſolution of your heart to love <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and to be like to him, muſt be unchangeable; nevertheleſs the wayes and means which are to be imployed to the nouriſhing and ſtrengthning of your reſolution, may and ought to be changed, according as you feel your ſelf diſpoſed, and find them to be effectual.</p>
               <p>But eſpecially let me remember you of this Advice which was long ſince given me by a good man, NOT TO BIND YOUR SELF UNALTERABLY TO VOLUNTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY CUSTOMS. Since theſe are impoſed upon us by our ſelves, we may grant our ſelves a releaſe when we we ſee it moſt convenient, and not tye our ſelves unto them, as if there were an indiſpenſible obligation ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon our conſcience. The rigorous obſervance of theſe, doth alwayes hinder the freedom of the heart in the Love of Jeſus, when a better courſe to promote us in it doth preſent it ſelf to our choice. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not think there is any neceſſity that you ſhould alwayes pray in the ſame way, or pray ſo long, or read ſo many Chapters in a day, or ſtudy ſuch a Book whereby you have reaped much benefit, or think eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day of the very ſame things; but you are at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do in theſe matters as ſhall moſt conduce to the ends for which they ſerve, and that is, The quickning of you to live agreeably to the Rules of Sobriety, Righteouſneſs and Godlineſs. Be not timerous and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:101895:90"/>fearful of ſtepping aſide out of your ordinary courſe, when you only leave what you have bound upon your ſelf by your own will, and go to do the Will of God. If we can do well, what matter is it, though it be not in the form that we have preſcribed? If our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be effected, why ſhould we trouble our heads becauſe it was not done in the order and method that we appointed? Is it not a madneſs to deny our ſelves a natural happineſs, becauſe we cannot have it according to the precepts of Art? It is juſt as if a man would not ſpeak nor hear Reaſon, unleſs it be in mode and figure; or as if a man would not be ſaved from drowning, unleſs a friend would bring a Boat to fetch him out of the water: or as if a captive Prince ſhould refuſe to ſatisfie his hunger, unleſs all his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and attendants were admitted to wait upon him. What a ſottiſh obſtinacy is this, thus to adhere to our Rules? What a rigorous Juſtice is it, that makes us unjuſt to our ſelves? What ſhall we do with this ſcrupulous Piety, which claps fetters and bolts upon our own leggs? We ſhould wonder if a man, to obſerve ſome unneceſſary terms of Law, ſhould ſuffer all Laws to periſh; and it is no leſs ſtrange if to maintain ſome free impoſitions, we ſuſtain a loſs in the moſt neceſſary improvements of our ſouls. This extreme right is an extreme injury. It would be an offence againſt reaſon, not to offend here againſt a form. And we ſhould very much depart from God, if we did not here depart a little from our ſelves.</p>
               <p>To this let me add another thing, which it will be profitable to you to be adviſed of; which is, that when you are following <hi>Jeſus</hi> in acts of Juſtice or Charity, or any of the reſt, you do as ſtrongly attract
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:101895:90"/>and draw down the bleſſing of Heaven upon you, as by the beſt devotions which you perform upon your knees. You do not think, I believe, that they are the words which you ſpeak, that have any virtue to charm the caeleſtial Powers, but that the Love to God which is expreſſed in Prayer, invites him to come and dwell with you. Now this Love is teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as much in other actions of an Holy Life, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when we deny our ſelves any ſenſible good in the performance of them; and therefore they cannot chuſe but re-inforce our Prayers, and redouble our Petitions, and call ſtill for new Grace to make us able to do better. Beſides, it is to be conſidered, that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good being the uſe and improvement of that Grace of God which we obtain by our Prayers, it muſt needs intitle us to the right which the Promiſe of God gives us, of more Grace to be added unto that which we have already received. We render to God hereby his own with Uſury and Increaſe; and ſo cannot miſs of procuring more Talents to be lent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. And indeed if you enter into a ſtrict Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of things, you will find that every act of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue hath the very ſame effect upon the Underſtanding and Will, which I attributed to Prayer it ſelf. For there is nothing more inlightens the Mind in the knowledge of good, than the experience and taſte which the practice of it gives us; and the Will is ſo effectually determined hereby to the choice of it, that it gets an habit, and naturally propends unto it. There is nothing can more diſpoſe the ſoul to well doing, than the doing well: and we are never more ſecure of the help of Gods good Spirit, than when we follow the motions of it.</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:101895:91"/>
               <p>Behold then what a dangerous Rock doth here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it ſelf, upon which many have daſht and ſplit themſelves, and periſhed. Men think there is no Communion with God, but what is held by Prayer, and ſuch like holy duties. Nay, as if this was all we have to do for maintaining friendſhip with him, it hath ingroſſed the name of duty, and incloſed the greateſt part of Religion in it ſelf. A ſtrange conceit! As if in the conſtant exerciſe of an Holy Life we did not keep a fellowſhip with him, by doing the ſame that he doth, and ſhewing forth his Virtues to the World. Is there any thing more viſible than that by Righteouſneſs, Charity, Patience and ſuch like, we approach to God, and are made partakers of him? Do we not feel him by theſe things? Are we not made one Spirit and Nature with him? Doth not he dwell in us, and we in him? What is the reaſon then that men confine Divine Communion to Prayer and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Sacrament, as if we never enjoyed him but in theſe immediate addreſſes to him? What is it that makes them imagine God is here to be found, and no where elſe? They know not ſure what it is to pray, and partake of thoſe holy My ſteries. They fancy it is but the pouring out ſuch a number of words, or the ſtirring of ſome devout affections in them. Theſe they conceive wil put them in the favour of God, and ſecure them there without any further labor. Which hath cauſed, it is like the corrupted Church to increaſe the number of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and create a great many more than God hath made. For it is an eaſie matter to receive theſe Seals of Grace, and there is no ſuch repugnance to them in our fleſhly nature as there is to the life of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Hence it is that men would have the whole ſumm of Religion to be contained in theſe ſmall volumes. They would
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:101895:91"/>have all Piety cloiſtered up in theſe narrow walls, and are loath to give it a larger compaſs. Within theſe limits they would willingly have it confined, and not have it walk abroad in our common converſation in the World. But if they had any true relliſh of vertue, they would ſoon diſcern that theſe Holy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are preparations for whatſoever elſe we have to do. They are ſo far from excluding all the reſt, that they include them every one and carry them in their Boſome. All the Vertues reſort hither, at the time when theſe are to be perform'd. Here they all agree to meet, and (as I may ſpeak) to keep their General Rendevouz, the better to ſtrengthen and advance each other. At theſe holy retirements they all come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to conſult for the preſerving of their common intereſt. There is not one of them abſent when we pray as we ought, or addreſs our ſelves in due manner to the Table of the Lord. Then they aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to joyn in one Band, in order to the making a more powerful impreſſion upon their enemies; and to increaſe their ſtrength, the better to incounter them at all times elſe. They are all in Action at once upon theſe occaſions. And by their united force do more mightily ingage the will to the love of them at all other ſeaſons. When we pray, we make a ſolemn acknowledgment of God in all his attributes. We confeſs him to be the Cauſe of all things. We extoll his Soveraign power and Supremacy over all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. We acknowledge his Independency, and our ſelves to live and move and have our being in him. We aſcribe to him Liberty and Freedom in that it is in his will and choice what, and when, and how much we ſhall injoy. We give him the Glory of his Fulneſs and Alſufficiency, of his Immenſity, his Omniſciency,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:101895:92"/>his Eternity and Immutability, his Goodneſs and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and of whatſoever other excellencies belongs unto him. We humble our ſelves alſo before him. We profeſs our Faith and confidence in him for all that he hath promiſed. We hope in his Mercy: and reſign our Souls and Bodies into his Hands to be governed by his Holy Laws. Prayer is the Silence of our Souls: the ſtilneſs and calm of all our Paſſions: the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and contentment of our Deſires: and in one word it is the Union of our Wills with the Divine.</p>
               <p>And if you turn your eye from hence to the Holy Sacrament of Chriſts Body and Blood, there you will find the very ſame concourſe of all the Graces to aſſiſt at that ſolemn time. They all conſpire to be preſent then to wait upon our Lord; and to improve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by exerting their utmoſt vigor and ſtrength in that Holy Action. The very buſineſs and imployment of a Chriſtian ſoul at that Feaſt is to celebrate the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodneſs with our higheſt praiſes, to profeſs our ſelves the Diſciples and followers of the Crucified <hi>Jeſus:</hi> to expreſs the greateſt paſſion of Love to him: to offer our Souls and Bodies to his ſervice: to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of his yoke and take his Croſs upon our ſhoulders: to embrace each other with a fervent Charity: to open our hearts unto all the World: to excite our ſelves to the doing of good: and to proclaim forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to all that have done us evil. Here all our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome Paſſions are laid aſleep, and dare not ſo much as ſtir; being now in the preſence of our Lord. They are all huſht and ſtill; out of the Reverence they bear to him and his Soveraign Authority. Here we can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be careful, nor angry, nor fearful, nor deſirous of any other thing but only Him and his Love. Nay,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:101895:92"/>here all the inordinacy of them is quelled, ſubdued and brought under the Government of his Laws. They are not only caſt into a ſleep, but mortified and ſlain at the ſight of the Paſſion of our Lord. Anger and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred give up the Ghoſt, and yield themſelves victims to his conquering Love. All our care for the World expires into the Boſome of God. All Fear vaniſhes, and turns into Faith and truſt in his Providence. All Pride and Vainglory dyes at the feet of his Humble Majeſty. The Impure deſires of the Fleſh receive their mortal wound, when we feel the pangs and ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and travel of His ſoul. There is nothing left but an indignation at our ſinful ſelves, a care to pleaſe him, an holy fear to offend him, an hatred of the very gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpotted with the fleſh; a love of Piety, and an ambition to be like to this Holy Saviour. It would be too long, if I ſhould tell you how all the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was at once expreſſed in his <hi>death:</hi> and how as he hung upon the Croſs, he acted all the Vertues which he had ſo long preached and practiſed. But you will ſoon diſcern by your own obſervation if you pleaſe but to look upon him in that laſt Scene of his Tragedy; that he never gave greater inſtances of his Humility, Charity, Meekneſs, Patience, Confidence in God, and contempt of the World, then when he left it in thoſe ſhameful and ignominious torments. And therefore ſince this Crucified <hi>Jeſus</hi> is ſo lively ſet before our eyes in this Holy Sacrament, we muſt either ſhut our eyes, or elſe he will imprint ſuch an Image and draw ſuch a Picture of himſelf upon our hearts, that all thoſe Graces will ſhine together there.</p>

               <p>HEre the Good man made a pauſe; the Other ſeeming as if he had a mind to interpoſe ſome doubt, or to make ſome obſervation upon what had been ſaid. But he modeſtly praying him to proceed, and telling him that he had no deſire to do any thing but only to hearken to his Inſtructions, which would ſooner tire the Giver then the Receiver; it was no long ſtop to his ſpeech which thus continued. I am ſo deſirous you ſhould think it is eaſier to underſtand then to follow the Chriſtian courſe which leads to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> that I would have you know there remains not much more to be added, then what relates to thoſe things which have been already ſpoken. But you having thus diſpoſed of your affairs and put your ſelf in ſuch good order as I have directed; it will be time to begin your journey in Gods Name thither. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſure at your ſetting out, that you confirm the Vow you have made by ſetting to it the Seal of that Holy Sacrament of which I have now diſcourſed. It will be a very good <hi>Viaticum</hi> for you, and in the ſtrength of this Food you may travel many dayes: ſtill looking at <hi>Jeſus</hi> whom you beheld there ſo feelingly repreſented. And truly you will find there is great need of fortifying your ſelf very well, for I muſt let you know that at your firſt ſtepping out of doors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have gone many paces, you will be incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:101895:93"/>with a World of enemies of ſeveral ſorts; that will beſet you round about and boldly aſſault your reſolution of going to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> We are told indeed as I have heard ſome relate out of <hi>Diodore</hi> of <hi>Sicily,</hi> that among the ancient <hi>Indians</hi> there were certain officers appointed on purpoſe to take care of <hi>Travellers</hi> and <hi>Strangers,</hi> and to ſee that no body did them any wrong. And if it chanced that any ſuch perſon did fall ſick they provided a Phyſitian for him, with all other things that the neceſſities of ſuch a condition did require. If he dyed they gave him a decent Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, and if he had any money or goods about him they took care to have them reſtored to his heirs if they could be found. But now you will very much deceive your ſelf if you expect ſuch kind uſage from the world, or think to be preſerved in your travels from their injuries and affronts. There is not ſo much Chriſtianity left among them as will equal the vertue of thoſe Pagans. Men are more buſie in paſſing the ſentence of Damnation upon them, then in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning themſelves for not excelling and outſtripping the Piety of Infidels. They take care for little elſe but to have it believed, that thoſe heathens ſhall not be ſaved notwithſtanding all their good works; and that they themſelves ſhall be ſaved notwithſtanding their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs of them. They will be ſo far from doing you any good, that they will not ſtick to do you harm. They who you would think ſhould be a guard to you, may prove the moſt dangerous enemies and take an opportunity to rifle you. There are many will be forward to offer you their ſervice, but it is becauſe they would willingly have an occaſion to betray you. They would be content no doubt to bury you, but it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are glad that they ſee you dead. And yet
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:101895:94"/>you muſt not think that evil men will be your only or your greateſt oppoſers; for there are ſundry others as I told you that will be ready to joyn their forces with them, and ſuch as are of a more dangerous and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant diſpoſition. There is never a thing you ſee in the world but it may prove an Adverſary and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to hinder you in your journey: but there are many beſides more potent which you do not ſee that will back and ſecond them in their miſchievous deſign. Though they diſagree never ſo much among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in other things, yet they will all combine toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and conſpire in this, to uſe their utmoſt ſkill and indeavour to check your deſires, and break your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, or at leaſt to give you many diſcouragements that may ſtop you in your courſe and hinder your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> I have known many <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims</hi> of great courage and undaunted Reſolution, and yet I could never hear of any whom more or fewer of theſe armed enemies had not the hardineſs to ſet upon: And ſome I have been acquainted with who were either forced or perſwaded by them to make a retreat after they were well advanced in their way thither. And therefore you muſt not think you ſhall be ſuch a priviledged Soul as to eſcape their aſſaults: ſince Heroical Vertue could never terrifie them from making a proof of its conſtancy and valour. And you muſt not think neither that they are without ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems and ſubtil Arts to deceive thoſe whoſe ſtrength they cannot overmaſter. They will ſpare neither lyes, nor flatteries, nor bribes, nor fine entertainments (if they ſee that Violence is like to effect nothing) to corrupt your mind and induce you to change once more and return home again to thoſe injoyments which you have quit and left behind you. There is
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:101895:94"/>nothing ſo afflicts them as to ſee a Soul in love with <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and reſolutely bent to travel for to find him. This urges them to uſe their greateſt induſtry and wit to extinguiſh that good will, with the loſs of which they know your journey will ceaſe and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Againſt theſe therefore you muſt be well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that when they come and make an impreſſion upon you; it may find ſuch a noble reſiſtance that it may fly back with ſhame in their own faces, and only ſet a mark of honour and token of Victory upon yours. And truly to expect and look for them, is half way to a conqueſt: their greateſt advantage lying in the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a Soul which fears no danger. Which makes this Warning that I give you before hand the more neceſſary, becauſe it is a part of your Armour, and not only an Alarm to make you careful to be well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
               <p>I believe you are deſirous to have ſome liſt of theſe Enemies; and therefore I think fit to let you know that you will find none more forward to ſet upon you, then ſome within your ſelf. The <hi>Fleſhly deſires</hi> I mean and the <hi>Worldly fears</hi> of your own naughty heart, who the more they have found you a friend to them hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, will now become the more peſtilent enemies and do you the greater miſchief. Theſe will be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing that you ſhould do ſo much as Pray, or Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate with any ſeriouſneſs of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and much more oppoſite will they be to the Life of Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſelf-denyal which they ſee you entring upon. If their conſent were firſt to be obtained, you ſhould not ſtir ſo much as one foot in this way wherein I have directed you. They would murmur and repine moſt ſadly; they would put a thouſand jealouſies in your
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:101895:95"/>mind, and remember you of as many ſervices which you owe them, without the performance of which they can never reſt contented. And therefore when you have made a little progreſs, and taſted ſome of the difficulties of your way; then is the opportunity of the <hi>Fleſh</hi> to ſet in ſtrongly with its reaſons, and to ſuggeſt to you that it is a courſe not to be indured. It cannot be expected that in ſo fit an occaſion it ſhould be ſilent, but that it ſhould intreat you of all Loves not to be ſo cruel as to proceed in your purpoſe and to deny it thoſe ſatisfactions which are not to be met withall in ſuch a diſmal rode. Sometimes it will cry out of the injuries that have been done it and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the violence that Temperance hath offered to its pleaſures, and the robberies which the poor have committed upon its goods, with other intolerable wrongs of the ſame nature: And ſometimes it will ſhriek and cry out for fear of the Danger and Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips that are ſtill inſuing, and will be ſure, as it fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, to make a total ſpoil of all its contentments. And though many of theſe piteous lamentations be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by you, yet it will not ceaſe; it is like, to follow you with them; and at ſome ſeaſons plainly to grapple with you and ſtruggle for the Victory. And ſince af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome difficulties that are overcome, there may well be ſuppoſed others to be remaining that will try your conſtancy; theſe will be ſure to be repreſented to you in a very formidable ſhape and made to appear far bigger and vaſter then really they are. That ſo your <hi>fleſhly deſires</hi> may have the fairer pretence to wiſh you to conſult for your eaſe and ſafety both together, by returning back to the place from whence you came. Many evil Spirits likewiſe there is no doubt, will joyn themſelves to this party: and obſerving the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:101895:95"/>that ſhall ariſe, they will uſe all the ſleights, and temptations, and power that they are Maſters of, to intice or draw your heart from the Love of Jeſus, and make you weary of proſecuting your purpoſe of going to him. But whatſoever any, or all of theſe ſhall ſay, and in whatſoever form they ſhall make either their addreſſes or aſſaults; believe not a word they ſpeak, or rather ſtop your ears as much as you can to all their chams. And be ſure at leaſt to betake your ſelf to that one ſecure Remedy which I told you of, anſwering thus unto them; <hi>I deſire nought but the Love of Jeſus, and to be with him in peace at Jeruſalem.</hi> This word will drive them all away, as having no hopes to find any room in thoſe ſouls that are full of ſuch deſires. And unleſs you ceaſe to ſay and think that, or you give it but a cold remembrance; they will let you go on in your way thither, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſturbance from ſuch perſwaſions.</p>
               <p>But yet when they ſee that they cannot be admitted at this door, they will try to enter in at another; or at leaſt they will endeavour to repreſs the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your courſe, and to make your way intricate and perplexed. For finding that you cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to be in love with them, or any of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, they will begin to throw ſcruples and fears into your mind, that you may bear an affection to ſome or other of them. When they cannot diſturb your Paſſions, they will be ſo ſubtil as to trouble your Fancy. And when they cannot perſwade you to break off your journey, they will labour to poſſeſs you with a conceit that you have not yet prepared your ſelf ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently for it. They will often be ſtirring up ſuch thoughts as theſe in your mind; that you have not
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:101895:96"/>waſhed your ſelf clean enough by ſorrow and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for your ſins; that your conſcience hath not been thorowly ſearched, nor your faults duly confeſſed, nor your heart rightly humbled, and deeply afflicted: and therefore that it would be beſt for you to return again, at leaſt for ſo ſhort a ſpace till you may be better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and ſo the better provided for travel. With much ſpeciouſneſs, and very fair ſhews of faithful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel will all this be repreſented: and they will make you believe, if they can, that you cannot pleaſe God better than by going back to the very place where you firſt began, in order to prepare your ſelf with more exactneſs for ſuch a long journey. But do not give any credit to a ſyllable of all this, nor think your ſelf obliged to ranſack your conſcience all over again, and to ſpend your time in I know not what penſiveneſs and tireſome humiliations. For theſe courſes may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger to keep you alwaies at home; either becauſe you will never think that you know the bottom of your heart, or becauſe you will ſtill ſeem not to be ſorrowful and penitent enough, or becauſe theſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours will even affright you from Religion, and make you think (as I have known ſome do) that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be ſaved. At leaſt theſe things will put you into uncouth and unknown wayes, and make others think that Piety is madneſs. They will hinder you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo exceeding much, ſo that (if you go on at all, yet) you will travel very ſlowly, and be a moſt tedious time before you come at <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Say therefore to theſe ſcruples, when they buzz in your ears; <hi>I am nought, I have nought, &amp;c.</hi> I have ſunk my ſelf as low as I can in my own eſteem, I have forſaken all, and carry no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in my heart as he knows but only <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and therefore moleſt me not in my paſſage to them.</p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:101895:96"/>
               <p>And if they ſhall ſtill proceed to tell you (upon the diſcovery of this Artifice to deceive you) that it is too great a boldneſs for ſuch a perſon as you, to think to ſee <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> if they ſay that you are not worthy of his favour, nor ought to be ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous as to hope for it; anſwer them again in the very ſame words, <hi>I am nought, I have nought, &amp;c.</hi> I know as well as you can tell me, that I am unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of any thing, and much more of his favour: but therefore it is that I deſire him, and am going to him, that I may have ſome worthineſs, by reſembling him.</p>
               <p>I do not preſume upon my own deſerts, but upon his Love; nor am I pricked forward by my own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires only, but by his invitations; nor was it my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but his own, which firſt put me upon this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of travelling to him. Nor ſhall you ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me to deſiſt in this enterprize, unleſs you can tell me from his own mouth, that he will do no good unto a ſinner (as I confeſs my ſelf to be) but I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to pray without ceaſing, and to labour perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually that I may be righteous, like to himſelf; and ſo be accepted with him. I am not ſo fooliſh indeed as to imagine that he will receive me to himſelf at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> if I become no better than I am; but I ſtudy by his Grace (which I know he is not wont to deny) to be made ſo conformable to his deſires, that he will not think me unworthy to be there entertained by him.</p>
               <p>And now if any old friend or acquaintance ſhould chance to croſs your way; and pittying that poor and deſolate condition wherein you ſeem to be, ſhould in civility invite you home to him, and pray you to accept of the kindneſs of their Country; or if he
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:101895:97"/>ſhould promiſe you ſome great pleaſures, and rare divertiſements to the fleſh, which are far more eligible in his opinion, than ſuch a miſerable Pilgrim's life as he ſees you lead; turn a deaf ear to him, and do not go along with him.</p>
               <p>Nay, if he only ſtop you in your journey by vain, frivolous and impertinent diſcourſes, which, you think, detain you too long from accompliſhing your intentions; break looſe from him as ſoon as you fairly can, and ſay only this to him, <hi>Sir, I would fain be at Jeruſalem.</hi> And if he perſiſt to trouble you, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you with his importunities to turn aſide to his dwelling, or to let him have more of your company; invite him to go along with you, and tell him that then he ſhall enjoy as much as he pleaſes of it. And if to theſe Temptations there ſhould many others ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the proffers of Gifts, Honours and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which will incommode you, and be a clog to you in your journey; regard them not, but ſtill bear in your minds the thoughts of what you ſhall have at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Which is not meant as if I thought the Rich and the Honourable could not get thither as well as we; but only to preſerve you from the greedy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the world, who catch at all that preſents it ſelf, though they ſtart out of their way to get it; and turn into an hundred by-paths to poſſeſs and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it.</p>

But when he ſaw that he did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ponder upon what he had ſpoken, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſo fixed, as if he had been chained to his mouth, and could not ſtir from thence; he went on in his diſcourſe, which he clearly diſcerned the poor ſoul moſt greedily received. You look, ſaid he, as if you were not at all dejected at what I have delivered; and perhaps you are the better ſatisfied, becauſe you expect to be entertained with more pleaſant news than hitherto hath ſaluted you. But I muſt deal ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with you, and ler you know that many of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in this way that you are to go, conſiſt more in beating enemies, than in having none; in victories and triumphs, rather than in not being expoſed to dangerous conflicts. And therefore be contented to hear that all your enemies will fall into a rage, and be filled with madneſs, when they ſee their ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems become ſo unſucceſsful. And that they may take ſome revenge for ſo ſhameful a diſappointment, they will procure that you be exceedingly deſpiſed and ſcorned as a very poor wretch, and a filly creature. They will ſet the very Boyes and Girls to laugh and hout at you: or, which is worſe, they will lay all the falſe things to your charge that they can
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:101895:98"/>deviſe, and throw in your teeth any old fault which you have committed, and not only brand you with very diſgraceful names, but alſo calumniate you as a man of ill deſigns. But if you will be ſafe, I charge you not to heed theſe things at all; no not if they go about to rob you, or proceed to beat you, or uſe you very deſpitefully, and perſecute you with as much violence as malice can miniſter to their fury. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what I now ſay unto you, as you love your life, and contend not with them, ſtrive not fiercely againſt them, nor ſpend ſo much as a fit of anger upon them. Content your ſelf as well as you can with the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage received, and paſs on quietly, as though no hurt had been done, leſt you involve your ſelf in worſe dangers, and ſuffer a far greater harm than they have in their power to do you. Carry this only in your mind, that to be at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in ſafety with <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> is a thing that ought to be purchaſed with far harder uſage than all this; and then you will not ſo much as repine at it, but be more comforted by your patience, than you could have been by remaining free from ſuch afflictions.</p>
               <p>Let this alſo be added for your ſupport, that if they ſee you are ſo hardy, as not to be at all moved by theſe affronts, but rather well contented with ſuch rude and dirty abuſes; it will give as great diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to them, as they hoped thereby to have given you. You will grow a very conſiderable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in their account, and they will ſtand in fear of you as one that is like to hearten many others in this jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, from which they labour by ſo many waies that they may be deterred. Which muſt not be expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as if their heart would not ſerve them to trouble
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:101895:98"/>you any longer when they ſee you return all their blows upon themſelves; for as long as their malice laſts, they will not ceaſe to be a vexation to you, and to labour to bring you into ſome new danger. Nay, it is likely they will from all theſe diſappointments only learn to go to work more craftily, and lay all their heads together to contrive ſome inſenſible waies of effecting your ruine. But, as I ſaid before, keep in your mind <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and they will give you ſecurity, and countermine all their plots to undo you. As for inſtance, it is poſſible they will endeavour to ſow ſome differences between you and your fellow-travellers, when you meet with any to bear you company. They will ſtudy to work in you an ill opinion, and to make you ſhy of each other; nay, to caſt ſuch bones of contention among you, that you ſhal grow paſſionate, fall out by the way, &amp; break company: of which ſeparation they will be the more deſirous, becauſe they know it is ſo profitable for you in your travels to have the benefit of good companions. Now if in this caſe you do but look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Jeſus;</hi> though the fire were already kindled, it would be inſtantly extinguiſhed. And if <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> do but come into your mind, if you do but caſt a glance upon that ſweet and quiet place; it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently make a calm in your ſoul, which cannot think it likely you ſhould come thither, but in the paths of Peace and Love. As much as in you lyeth therefore, live peaceably with all men, and much more with your Brethren and Companions. And as one of the Eldeſt Guides that ever travelled this way hath left us directions, let it be ever a principal part of your care, <hi>to keep the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace.</hi>

               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:101895:99"/>
               <p>I hope that what I now ſay, together with that diſpoſition which brought you hither to me, will render one caution (which elſe ſhould have been here interpoſed) as unneceſſary to you, as it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in it ſelf: which is, That you enter not into hot diſputes, and ſharp contentions with any man, no not about the Opinions in which they pretend Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is concerned. But yet let me paſs an Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or two upon thoſe Conteſts which ſeem to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ſo much of ſome mens zeal, and tell you; That I do not remember I have been acquainted with any man who was in love with Controverſies, that much mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the way to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or ſtudied to be ſo able to do the Will of God, as to confute and ſilence the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries that he oppoſed. This wrangling piece of Learning, is alwaies wont to leave the moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truths, that it may purſue thoſe which are are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable and good for nothing. Nay, it is obſerved by wiſ men, to be generally accompanied with this baſe quality; that it cannot exerciſe the Underſtanding without provoking the paſſions, nor ſpeak of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration it ſelf without diſtemper, nor treat of peace and quietneſs, without putting the ſoul into diſorder. And therefore I could never diſcern that ſuch Diſputers have any great faculty of deſcrying the Truth about which they contend; but make that a matter of great difficulty and perplexity which the peaceable people, and they who are free from paſſion and prejudice, do eafily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. And here I ſhall not ſtick to refreſh your mind a little with the pleaſure of a Story or Parable which I have ſomewhere met withall out of <hi>Anſelme</hi> a man of no mean eſteem in the times wherein he lived. There were two men, ſaith he, who a little before the Sun
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:101895:99"/>was up, fell into a very earneſt debate concerning that part of the Heavens wherein that Glorious body was to ariſe that day. In this Controverſie they ſuffered themſelves to be ſo far ingaged, that at laſt they fell together by the ears, and ceaſed not their buffetings till they had beaten out each others eyes. And ſo it came to paſs that when a little after, the Sun did ſhow his face, there was neither of theſe doughty Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that could diſcern one jot a thing ſo clear as the Prince of lights, which every child ſaw beſide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It would be too great a diſparagement to your underſtanding, if I ſhould ſpend a moment in teaching you to apply it to our preſent purpoſe. It is ſufficient to add, That though zeal for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion be not only commendable, but required of us, yet we muſt take great heed leſt we ſtrive ſo hotly and paſſionately for every Opinion which we have conceived, that we quite loſe our faculty of diſcovering either that, or any thing elſe which is truly good. I may well ſay any thing elſe; for theſe controverſies in Religion I have heard ſome wiſe men obſerve, do much hinder the advancement of other Sciences and the increaſe of good knowledge in the World. And therefore a great Reſtorer of Learning among our ſelves was wont to ſay, that he was like the Miller near one of our famous Univerſities, who uſed to pray for peace among the Willows. For while the wind blew and the Windmills wrought, the Watermill was leſs cuſtomed. And juſt ſo it is with theſe diſputes: while they are high and ſet mens wits in agitation, they draw away their thoughts from other profitable ſtudies, and hinder their minds from ſuch noble inquiries as would do a great ſervice to mankind. Pray therefore for the peace of thoſe that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:101895:100"/>travel to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and do you ſeek it and purſue it by all means poſſible. Or if any be contentious and obey not the truth; mark ſuch perſons and avoid them.</p>
               <p>And truly there are ſo many enemies as you have heard to exerciſe our zeal, that we had not need to create more and to ſeek for enemies among our ſelves. They are ſo combined and confederate for our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and undoing, that it ſtands us in hand to unite our forces alſo for our mutual defence and not to give them that advantage which they greedily gape for and will certainly have by our ſad diviſions. So great is their ſubtilty and ſo intent they are to make the utmoſt uſe of it, that if we have any wit it had need be joyned to obviate their deſigns, and not imployed to make wide breaches, at which without much difficulty they may eaſily enter and deſtroy us. For, beſides all the wayes of deceiving us that have been already related, I muſt not forget to remember you of a condition into which you may fall, of which they will not fail to ſerve themſelves as much as they are able. It is poſſible I mean that ſome way or other a fit of ſickneſs may ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize you in your journey; or it may ſo happen that ſuch a great want may be your portion, that no man will offer you any help, or regard your cryes when you beg for relief. At this ſeaſon your enemies will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about you, and as if they meant at once to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you up, they will put ſtrange fancies into your head and abuſe your mind with ſuch black and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly thoughts as may prove no ſmall affliction to you. They will inſult over you, and tell you that your folly and preſumption in undertaking this tedious journey, hath reduced you to ſo great extremities: or that
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:101895:100"/>ſome hainous ſin for which you have not yet been humbled, is the cauſe of this ſad condition: or that you are one whom <hi>Jeſus</hi> hates, which hath made him to abandon you to theſe ſtraights to chaſtiſe your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence: or that he loves you ſo little, as not to care whether any body mind you: or at leaſt that you have ſo ill deſerved of mankind, that none of them regards you or hath any ſollicitude for your welfare. And all theſe tales they will tell over and over again in your ears, to feed your melancholy and diſquiet of Spirit; to make you murmur and fall into diſcontent; to breed in you an ill opinion of your <hi>Jeſus,</hi> or to provoke you to anger and diſpleaſure againſt your Brethren; and if it be poſſible to work you into ſuch uncharitable thoughts of them, that you ſhould never love them any more. But now it will concern you very much to ſtop your ears to all theſe lamentable ſtories, and to make as if you heard them not at all. You muſt ſay over your old leſſon as oft as they repeat theſe ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions and whiſper to your ſelf theſe words, <hi>I am nought,</hi> I deſerve theſe miſeries; it is not ſtrange that I am ſick or poor, but that I am no worſe. And then, if you pleaſe, you may defie all theſe enemies and let them know that you do not ſo much as deſire the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of theſe burdens, nor care for any thing in the World but only for the <hi>Love of Jeſus, and to be with him in peace at Jeruſalem.</hi> Tell them, you cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he hates a man who is poſſeſſed with this Deſire; but howſoever it be, that you are reſolved to try him by going on and perſevering perpetually in it.</p>
               <p>But then if it ſhould happen that any of theſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults which I have named ſhould prove ſo ſtrong as
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:101895:101"/>not only to ſhake you but alſo to make you ſtumble, yea to throw you down and to give you ſuch a fall that thereby ſome hurt is done you: Or ſuppoſe that you ſhould chance to ſtep aſide and to divert a little out of the direct path which leads to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> you muſt know that they will make a foul ſtir about it, and accuſe you heavily for having done that, which they laboured with all their power to make you do. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell you how you will look upon your ſelf in ſuch a caſe if you ſhould ſlide into it, but if you will follow my advice, I would not have you to eſteem it ſo great and horrid a matter as they will make it, nor ſuffer your ſelf to be affrighted and aſtoniſhed at it. All that any wiſe man would bid you do in ſuch a condition is no more but this; That as ſoon as you obſerve your fall and are come to your ſelf again, you get up pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, return into the old path, and uſe ſuch remedies and medecines as every good body preſcribes in ſuch caſes. Conſider ſeriouſly by what means you were drawn aſide, humble your ſelf at the feet of God; be afflicted, mourn and weep ſo far that the ſmart you ſuffer may keep you hereafter from the ſin; ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then your reſolution; fortifie your ſelf in thoſe weak places where you are lyable to ſurpriſe; be more watchful for the future, and more inſtant in prayer for the aides of Divine grace. But when this is done be ſure you do not lye along upon the ground crying and bewailing your misfortune, nor ſtand amazed in your errour complaining that you have been ſo miſerably miſlead. For I am certain this will do you more harm then good, and give your enemies ſuch advantage againſt you, that they will double their laughter at your folly; firſt for your fall, and then for your lying along or ſtanding ſtill after you was caſt down. And
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:101895:101"/>truly I am of the opinion, that your fall will not do them ſo much ſervice as your lying ſtill: and that they will not clap their hands ſo much to ſee you down, as to ſee that you have no heart to riſe, but go about to bury your ſelf in ſorrow. If you would deject them and ſpoil their mirth, lift up your ſelf from the earth; and when you are upon your legs again, remember for what end they are beſtowed upon you. Proceed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward I mean in your journey as faſt as you can, and do not think it is to any purpoſe to ſtand looking into your wounds and weeping into your ſores. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that all that time you make no progreſs in your way, the wounds themſelves alſo are made more angry and you hinder the ſpeedineſs of the Cure. Provide therefore that they be inſtantly bound up, that the parts may cloſe and unite together, that your ſtrength may return, and your journey may be continued with as much courage and alacrity as it was begun. But immoderate grief I aſſure you will never ſuffer this; which will rather keep the wounds open, make your weakneſs greater, and cauſe the ſtop which hath been occaſioned by your fall to laſt longer. I know your enemies will be alwayes caſting this miſcarriage in your teeth, and be calling upon you to remember the place where they tript up your heels: but whatſoever they ſay, do not think your ſelf obliged to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually turning your head that way, nor to be ever looking back upon your lapſe and your pain. For they intend nothing elſe but to detain you in your courſe: and if they cannot freez your blood and make you ſtand ſtock ſtill in a cold amazement, yet they hope hereby to diſ-ſpirit your ſoul and render you ſo dull, lumpiſh and unfit for travel, that you ſhall move but a very ſlow pace in the way to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Be not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:101895:102"/>therefore, I beſeech you, of theſe devices, but take heed leſt they make as great advantage of your ſorrow as they could of your ſin. So you be drown'd and ſwallow'd up, they care not whether it be by over much pleaſure, or by over much grief. They can ſerve themſelves of your ſpiritual trouble and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mind, as well as of your carnal delights and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily injoyments. They can make uſe of either to draw you from God, or at leaſt if by the one they draw you away from him, they will labour by the other to keep you from returning back unto him.</p>
               <p>Nay, ile tell you a fetch they have beyond this. When they have immerſed you as deep as they can in ſorrow, if they perceive you are aware of their deſign and that you reſolve not to ſink any further nor to be overwhelmed with it; then will they make that ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which you have already felt, to be the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of plunging you into a new gulph of which you did not ſo much as dream. They will take that very part upon them, which you your ſelf ſhould have acted before; and tell you that it was very ill done to ſpend ſo much of your pretious time in unprofitable grief. They will call you Fool for your labour, in afflicting your ſoul ſo long. They will perſwade you, it was a new ſin to waſt thoſe hours in bewailing your offences, which ſhould have been imployed in amending of them. And therefore it is but neceſſary that I warm you again to be before hand with them and to ſecure this weapon for your own uſe. Keep it I ſay in your own power, leſt if they wreſt it from you, it ſerve them in due ſeaſon to wound you withall. Let your ſoul know from your ſelf that it is not fit to ſtand wringing your hands when you ſhould be uſing them
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:101895:102"/>in your work; and do not ſtay to hear this from your enemies mouth. Do not let them have the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſee you caſt down ſo immoderately by your own means, that if you riſe, it may be only to fall again by theirs. But put them to as great an affliction by the diſcovery of their practiſes, as they would have made you indure by the ſucceſs of them. Let them know that your errour ſhall only make you take the greater heed, that you mean to go the faſter by your fall, and to recompenſe your remiſneſs with an higher zeal. But as for affliction and ſorrow, that you will reſerve your ſelf for them till a time when they ſhall be more profitable, then now that you have a mind to be doing better then ever. Tell them that you do not intend to ingage Religion againſt it ſelf, nor make it guilty of being an hindrance to its own proper buſineſs. Give them to underſtand that ſince you have done your ſelf ſo much miſchief already, you will take care there be no addition to it by the means of the pious pretences of deep Humiliations. Remember them effectually of the old obſervation which may ſerve to quaſh them in the midſt of their greateſt triumphs over you, <hi>viz.</hi> That thoſe things which for the time that is paſt are worſt of all, may prove for the time to come to be the beſt. We take advice of the future of thoſe things which are gone by us. Good counſels in our after-actions owe not a little to the miſcarriages of former dayes. Our follies do teach us wiſdome, and by lapſes we learn to go more ſteadily.</p>
               <p>And if they continue ſtill to inſult and to make ado about this buſineſs, give not the leaſt regard to them; but call to your ſoul continually and cry, On, on, (my Soul) ſtand not to hearken to what they ſay, look not
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:101895:103"/>back again, get thee forward as faſt as thou canſt; and in ſtead of loſing more time by theſe dejections of ſpirit; let us ſtudy by our courage to regain that which we have already loſt. Nay, I would have you to proceed in your courſe, juſt as if nothing at all had hapned, keeping <hi>Jeſus</hi> in your mind and a vehement renewed deſire and indeavour to continue in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; which he is never wont to deny thoſe, whoſe hearts are ſincerely bent to pleaſe him.</p>
               <p>And yet it may happen after all this that you may meet with a worſe uſe that they will make of your lapſes. They may take occaſion from thence to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to be well contented with ſuch miſcarriages and not to trouble your ſelf to amend ſuch faults as have no remedy. Their indeavours will not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to poſſeſs you with an opinion, which hath infected too many minds; That you cannot imitate <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but have undertaken an impoſſible taſk which you will never be able to perform. This they may repreſent with a great deal of artifice and many fair colours: ſaying, Alas poor Soul! in what a vain and idle labour haſt thou ingaged thy ſelf? what meaneſt thou thus to ſtrain thy wings in aſpiring to that which no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on earth can reach? Doſt thou think to be like the Son of God? To wiſh to be ſo good, is the higheſt perfection of humane weakneſs. But to go about it; is only to make a more large diſcovery of that natural frailty. It is a pattern too illuſtrious for thee to look upon, much more to follow. It belongs not to meer men to be ſuch great undertakers. Thou mayſt as well think to work miracles, as deſign to imitate his Vertues. It lyes not within the compaſs of fleſh and blood to become ſo ſpiritual and divine. And if
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:101895:103"/>thou hadſt not already forgotten thy falls, thou couldſt not dream of raiſing thy ſelf to ſo high a pitch. Can any heart put up ſuch affronts with patience as thou meeteſt withall? Who can indure ſuch abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, or exerciſe ſuch Charity, or practiſe ſuch Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as thou ſeeſt in <hi>Jeſus?</hi> Sit down vain man, and comfort thy ſelf in this, that He hath done ſo worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It is enough to praiſe and extol ſuch perfections: but it is too much to arrive at them. There is no man in his wits would trouble himſelf about a buſineſs, though he apprehend his obligations never ſo great that preſs him to it; when he hath ſo good an excuſe as this at hand, that is not poſſible to be effected.</p>
               <p>I cannot ſtay to tell you the long ſpeeches that they will detain you withall in this Argument. Only you may know that there is no Theme more eaſie and plauſible than this, wherein to dilate themſelves: and therefore you may expect a world of ſpecious reaſons to induce you to believe that no man can obey the Commands of Chriſt, or follow his great Example. Which perſwaſion, if they can by any means in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill into your ſoul, I muſt aſſure you before-hand, that it will prove the moſt dangerous temptation that ever made an aſſault upon you. It will cut (as I may ſo ſpeak) the very ſinews of your ſpirit, and cramp your ſoul, ſo that you will never be able to travel to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> This infuſion will not only diſcourage you, but perfectly benum you, and make you languiſh in a perpetual lethargy. The opinion of <hi>Neceſſity</hi> doth not more quicken and excite us, than that of <hi>Impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> doth deaden and diſ-ſpirit us in any undertaking. And therefore now if ever, you muſt run as faſt as you can to the extract which I gave you. You muſt take
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:101895:104"/>a good draught of thoſe enlivening ſpirits which I commended, and are incloſed in that ſentence which you muſt carry along with you. You muſt repeat it again and again; <hi>I deſire nothing but Jeſus; nothing but Jeſus.</hi> He hath filled my ſoul with a purpoſe to go to him. He hath inſpired me with ſtrong reſolutions to follow after him. And ſure He will not fail to be my help, my ſtrength, and my ſalvation.</p>
               <p>And here let me beſeech you to conſider diligently before-hand, that they are his own words to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples juſt before he left the world,<note place="margin">Joh. 13.15</note> 
                  <hi>I have given you an example, that you ſhould do as I have done to you:</hi> And how that one of thoſe perſons hath alſo told us, That <hi>he left us an example that we ſhould follow his ſteps.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.21</note> To what end, I pray you, did He give us that which we cannot take? What are we the better for the Copy which he hath left, if it be ſuch as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tranſcribe? Did he intend to brave us, rather than inſtruct us by his actions? Were they meant to upbraid out imbecillity, and not to inſpire us with courage and ſtrength? Inſtead of provoking our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, were they only deſigned to make our ambition deſpair? And when he ſhould have awakned our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, did he only come to aſtoniſh us with wonders, and caſt our ſouls into a ſtupifying admiration? Theſe are baſe and leud ſuppoſals, of which the ancient Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims did never ſo much as dream. They thought they ſaw in him what mortal men by the Grace of God might hope to attain. They lookt upon him as the advancer of humane Nature, not only in his own perſon, but alſo in all thoſe who would undertake to follow him. They were incouraged and inflamed by beholding him to imitate his heavenly life: and by his
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:101895:104"/>Grace have left us themſelves as inſtances and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of that excellent virtue which Believers on Jeſus may come unto. They imitated him ſo happily, that they themſelves are become Originals. They cry out aloud unto us, that we ſhould be <hi>followers of them, as they were of Chriſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor 11.1</note> And muſt we now ſtand only gazing upon them; and ſpend our time in commending the Piety of ancient dayes? Muſt we think that thoſe were priviledged Ages which were attended with ſuch a Grace that doth not deſcend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on future ſucceſſions? Did the favours of Heaven dye with thoſe great ſouls? Muſt wee ſeek for Chriſtians only under their ruines, and in their Monuments? Muſt we adore their reliques in Books, and pleaſe our ſelves in Idaeas, and Patterns of things which we cannot imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate? Is it enough that we live in a profound ſleep, if it be but interrupted ſometimes with pleaſant viſions? Do they ſpeak only to the firſt-born children of Chriſt, when they ſay, <hi>Brethren,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3.13</note> 
                  <hi>be followers together of us, and mark them which walk ſo, as you have us for an enſample?</hi> Was it the priviledge of their birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right to be ſo good, and muſt we be contented to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main bad? Are we ſuch puiſnees that muſt expect no portion of Divine Grace,<note place="margin">Eph 5.1</note> or think of being <hi>followers of God as dear Children of his?</hi> For the Love of God let us not think that his treaſures are exhauſted, or that he is weary of his firſt munificence. His arm is no ſhorter than it was, nor are his hands leſs open. He is ſtill willing to diſpenſe his largeſſes, and to make us know that they did not end with thoſe Ages. Let us rouze up our ſelves therefore, and not loſe the benefits of Heaven, by thinking we cannot have them. Let us not impute to it ſuch an unkindneſs of giving us ſo high an example, that it might oblige us to an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:101895:105"/>trouble. Theſe are the old ſubtilties of the Serpent, which the Heathen Divines have detected as well as we. The Philoſophers themſelves were haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with theſe clamours, and the people rang this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in their ears; it is impoſſible to follow ſuch examples as you propoſe. But they ſet themſelves ſtoutly againſt this ſluggiſneſs. They purſued mens ſouls that made theſe excuſes, and ferretted them out of ſuch pretenſes wherein they ſought to borrow, and to make a Sanctuary for their lazineſs. You imagine, ſaith one of them, that thoſe things cannot be done, which you do not. You will needs have them far to ſurmount the nature of man, becauſe you will not be at the pains to acquire them. How much better do I think of you, than you do of your ſelves? I honour you ſo far, that I am of the mind you can be ſo good, but only you will not apply your ſelves unto it. For, Who is there that hath made a tryal with all his heart, that failed in the attempt? Who hath buckled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the work, that was deſtitute of ſtrength? To whom have not theſe things appeared more eaſie in the act, than in the imagination? The very truth of the buſineſs is, <hi>That it is not becauſe they are ſo difficult that we dare not enter upon theſe things; but becauſe we dare not enter upon them, therefore they are difficult.</hi> We af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright our ſelves with imaginary hardſhips: and this fear magnifies objects, and infinitely multiplies every individual. Be but pleaſed reſolutely to undertake the taſk, and you ſhall find it as ſweet and eaſie as now it ſeems harſh and formidable. Do but think that all things yield to hard labour, and you have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the greateſt difficulties by that one thought.</p>
               <p>Do you hear, Sir, what this perſon ſaith? Shall we
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:101895:105"/>not have as much courage as Heathens? Is there not ſo much of God remaining among us, as inſpired them with ſuch ſtrong reſolutions? It ſeems to me that he hath touched the right ſtring, and did we not ſupine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglect our ſelves, and forget even the words of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> we ſhould conclude, That <hi>to him that believeth all things are poſſible.</hi> We hinder the proficiency of our ſouls in Piety, juſt as men do the advancement of good Learning. There are few that underſtand (as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you have heard it obſerved) either the Eſtate they poſſeſs, or their Abilities to purchaſe more: but they think the one is greater, and the other leſs than indeed they are. So it comes to paſs, that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing what they have already acquired, they make no further ſearch, nor think of a due progreſs: or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing the power that God hath given them, they expend their ſtrength and force, in things of leſſer conſequence, and make no experiment of thoſe which are the higheſt and nobleſt improvement of their minds. They content themſelves to read and pray, and confeſs their ſins, and take theſe for the beſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of Chriſtians. Theſe are the <hi>fatal Pillars,</hi> beyond which they have no hopes to penetrate. Here they make a ſtand, when they ſhould go on to all other actions of an Holy Life. They run round in a perpetual circle of theſe Duties, when they ſhould move forward to a compleat imitation of their Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour. Rouze up your ſelf therefore, I beſeech you, and do not deſpair by his aſſiſtance of following the great Example which he and his Holy Ones have left us. As the opinion men have of their wealth is the cauſe of want; ſo the conceit of an incurable weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is the cauſe that we do no better. They that are gone before us, have not left us to ſigh and mourn
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:101895:106"/>that we cannot go after them. They have not rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed us of all the Glory of doing well. We in this preſent Age, if we do but ſtir up the Grace of God which is in us, need not degenerate from the brave examples of our predeceſſors. Let us but look upon them now, and in good time we may look upon our ſelves. As their example will incourage and excite our ſouls at preſent; ſo hereafter we ſhall draw much ſpirit from our own. Having done ſo well at firſt, we ſhall bluſh not to do better afterward. And while we imitate others, we ſhall at leaſt indeavour with all our might to excel our ſelves.</p>
               <p>I can ſee no hinderance that lyes in our way but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our own lazineſs, together with this weak perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion wherewith our enemies labour to poſſeſs us: That <hi>becauſe the buſineſs is not preſently done, it is not likely to be done at all.</hi> And yet to ſay the truth, I think that our Idleneſs is to bear the blame of this perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion alſo; for otherwiſe we ſhould never entertain ſuch unreaſonable apprehenſions. There are a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men that would do well, if they had but the courage to indure for a few daies. They have eager motions, or rather furious paſſions, and if the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could be done in a moment, or in that fit, there would not be braver men than they. But they are not willing to carry on a deſign of any length: they cannot hold out to make a work and a labour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming good: and ſo their ſlothful humour makes them, after the firſt attempt, to give back, and to cry out, <hi>to be better than we are it is impoſſible.</hi> A long march after our Saviour is a Bug-bear that affrights them. A tedious War with their enemies quite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirits them. They are loth to be at the pains of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:101895:106"/>many reſiſtances, and undergoing a laborious and continued courſe of deſtroying their oppoſers. They would not be ſouldiers all their life: nor ever ingaged in a combate with their Adverſaries. They ſee their ſins, but they either ſeem ſo great, that they imagine they cannot be vanquiſhed: or at leaſt they will not be at the trouble of it, if it cannot be done in an inſtant. After the firſt on-ſet, which is commonly very violent, they are wont to cool and make a retreat if they meet with any difficulties. They would have all effected now, and nothing left to be done to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. They do not care for overcoming their enemies, but they had rather end the War with them; or if they muſt fight, it ſhall be but one Battel. They would not be at the trouble of getting the better of any oppoſition; but they wiſh there were none, or that it were ſoon removed. They love the peace which will follow the victory, but they have no liſt to obtain it by a prolonged War. They would have their Adverſaries yield without many blows, and are content to engage but once for all againſt them. In this encounter, you would not think there were to be found any ſouls that are more couragious. They are all on fire, and you would take them to be more than men. But it is their idleneſs and ſloth that makes them thus active. It is their cowardiſe, and not their valour that puts them into ſuch a fury. It is becauſe they would have no more to do; but only to enjoy their eaſe, and take their repoſe. They had rather have nothing at all to do; but if they muſt imploy their Arms, they deſire inſtantly to lay them aſide again. You miſtake them if you think they have a mind ſo much as to conquer, and triumph, and reign; all they deſire is only to live, and be in quiet. But if
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:101895:107"/>they muſt needs overcome, and they cannot otherwiſe have their wiſhes; they would do it preſently, and by once taking pains, ever after have leave to play. Do not therefore deceive your ſelf, nor take a meaſure ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their courage, or of the ſucceſs by one impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon your enemies.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.36</note>

Nothing can more provoke their ſpirits then to find that all they ſay is ſlighted and diſ-regarded. There are no words you can ſpeak of them that they eſteem ſo reviling, as the ſcorn you put upon them by not hearkning to any of their words to you. It will incenſe them to take a ſudden revenge, when they ſee you ſo obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved as to force your way through the midſt of all the difficulties wherewith they ſurround you. This will neceſſitate them to invent a new Method to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe you and to lay their trains in a way quite differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from the preceding: which though they may ſeem not hard to diſcover, yet have more of Malice, if not of Craft, then any other. For now it is poſſible they will fain a compliance with you and make as if they neither could, nor had a mind any longer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt you. They will commend your conſtancy, and praiſe your reſolute mind, and indeavour to make you
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:101895:108"/>believe that they are ſo ſenſible of it, that they will forbear to trouble you. Nay, to ſuch a complaiſance will they form themſelves, that you ſhall hear no more of the badneſs and difficulty of the way wherein you are; but they will ſay, it is excellent, eaſie and void of all dangers, which are now diſheartned from preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to a mind that is only reſolved to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them. By this means they will ſecretly labour to cauſe a very good opinion of your ſelf to ſteal into your mind, and ſtudy to blow you up into an empty conceit of your own worth and ſufficiency. They will bring before you all the good deeds that you have done and diſplay your Victories before your eyes and let you know what a gallant perſon you are accounted. They will tell you how all men admire you; that the whole world muſt needs love you and have you in great eſteem for your piety; yea, even venerate the ſanctity of your Converſation. They will not ſpare to ſay that you have ſhown ſuch love to <hi>Jeſus</hi> as none can equal, and eſpecially that your courage and valour is ſo eminent that it is above their praiſes. And all this with a great deal more they will ſuggeſt unto you, only to breed in you as lofty an eſteem of your piety as they perſwade you others muſt needs have of it; and to puff you up with ſuch a vain joy, that you may pleaſe your ſelf in your ſelf and forget to go forward to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But if you tender at all your own well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and would not miſcarry after you have done ſo worthily, hold all this for an illuſion and a dangerous piece of flattery.

               <p>And here I ſhould have entred a ſerious caution againſt Spiritual Pride and a vain conceit of your own abilities, with which moſt of the world is infected; but that is included already in the general advice that I have given you: and beſides I ſee you are ſo humble as to become a learner. It may ſeem indeed a thing worthy of little or no praiſe for thoſe who are Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to come to be inſtructed; but there are few I aſſure you of our contentious Chriſtians though never ſo ſilly who are yet arrived at this perfection. They think themſelves fit not only to diſpute with their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, but to be his Teachers. They are his Maſters rather then his Schollers: and they do not only call him in queſtion, but boldly deliver their opinion of him. If they had ſo much modeſty and ſenſe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duty left, as to bring their doubts unto him about what he ſayes, it could not but be eſteemed a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable care of their ſouls. But alas! they are grown to that degree of inſolence and are ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly arrogant, that they have poſſeſſed themſelves of the chair, and ſit as Judges of his Sermons. What elſe means the rebukes which they meet withall, the haſty cenſures which are paſſed upon them, and the Magiſterial ſentence which is inſtantly pronounced with ſuch a peremptorineſs, as if there lay no appeal from the Bar of their underſtanding? It hath been my hard hap to converſe with many of them; and among the reſt I fell into the company of one the other day, who ſpake of his Guide with ſuch a ſcorn, and condemned his Sermons with ſo much confidence and laught ſo loudly at his Ignorance, and likewiſe
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:101895:109"/>cavilled ſo impertinently at his expreſſions when he had nothing to ſay againſt the ſenſe of what he had ſpoken, that a well diſpoſed man (though a little fierce) ſaid he had ſome doubt whether the Devil did not appear unto us to try if he could infect us with the leproſie of his Pride and Paſſion. And indeed I thought that I never ſaw thoſe things more evident in any man, except it was in another of the ſame ſort who came to cheat us (as a neighbour of mine ſaid) in the ſhape of an Angel of light. This Perſon after a great many godly expreſſions, whereby it is like he deceived himſelf into an opinion of his Saintſhip, fell into a kind of Chriſtian compaſſion, and ſeemed to have his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels yerning over his Teacher; ſaying, Alas poor man! my ſoul is grieved for him: He is ſo weak and unquallified for the work he hath undertaken. He is utterly void of the Spirit, and underſtands not the workings of it in the hearts of Gods people. I can never think of him but it pitties me to ſee how much he is in the dark: a ſtranger to the power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the myſteries of the Covenant of Grace. Poor Soul! who puts us upon doing (and they ſay is careful of that himſelf) but knows not what it is to believe. Is it not a great happineſs Sir that we have the teachings of the Spirit; and that the vail is taken from our eyes which ſtill hangs before the men of the World? Hath not Chriſt done much for us who hath made us wiſer then our Teachers?—</p>
               <p>I could not for my heart but here interrupt him (knowing that the perſon whom he thus undervalued was a true lover of our Saviour and excellently ſkill'd in his Religion) or elſe I think we ſhould have heard as much in his own praiſe as we had in the others diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:101895:109"/>But the truth is, I never heard any thing ſo fulſome from the mouth of man; and found my ſelf far more impatient of ſuch filthy ſtuff, than he could be of the Sermons at which he expreſſed ſo great diſlike. And, to ſay nothing at all of the man, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think that this Spirit is the very Firſt-born of the Devil, the eldeſt of all the daughters of Pride, the Prince of Darkneſs in the garments of Light, the dregs of Chriſtian Phariſaiſm which now as much deſpiſes Chriſts Miniſters, as the Jewiſh did Chriſt and his Apoſtles. God I hope will never ſuffer you to ſuck in this poiſon of the Serpent, nor lick up this vomit of the old Scribes and Phariſees. I diſcern me-thinks that you are as far from it, as they were from the Kingdom of Heaven, or elſe I ſhould beſtow more time upon you to ſeaſon you againſt this leaven, which will ſowre the whole lump of your Religion and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it as offenſive to God as it ſelf is to all ſober Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. But I need not have ſaid ſo much: I muſt ſuppoſe you as empty of all humanity as this diſpoſition is of Chriſtianity, as far from Reaſon as it is from the Spirit of God, or elſe hope that this Spiritual Pride, this devout Devil ſhall never poſſeſs you. For what is it but madneſs (even in the opinion of thoſe men) for one that was never bred in the myſteries of that profeſſion, to come into an Apothecaries ſhop, and there to condemn all his Drugs and Medicines for rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and corrupt, to ſpit upon his compoſitions, and offer to throw them all out of doors as fit to be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with the dirt? And yet there is not more ſenſe in the humour of thoſe perſons that uſe the Sermons they hear after that faſhion: which evidently proves that they deſerve not the name of Sober, much leſs of Wiſe and underſtanding Chriſtians. Though the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:101895:110"/>matter of ſuch diſcourſes have been long conſidered and duly weighed, and diligently compoſed out of the Word of God; yet theſe men who do not ponder them ſo many Minutes as their Inſtructers do dayes, and have no more ſkill in thoſe matters then in their neighbours trades which they never profeſſed; reject them at firſt hearing, beſpatter them with their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant cenſures, and (as if they were in a frantick fit) caſt them out, as they would fain do their Authors, like unſavoury ſalt that is good for nothing but to be troden under feet.</p>
               <p>It will ſeem a wonder perhaps unto you that ſuch men as theſe ſhould eſteem themſelves Religious, How is it poſſible, will you be ready to ſay, that ſuch a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious want of Modeſty and Humility of Spirit ſhould not make them ſuſpect their want of true Chriſtianity? I know indeed that nothing is more confident then Ignorant heat, but I marvel that in their cool moods, they do not accuſe themſelves at leaſt of raſhenſs and inconſiderate zeal. And truly I ſhould ſtand amazed at it too, did I not know that there is ſuch a fair counterfeit of Religion in the World that not only deceives others, but thoſe alſo in whom it is. You behold every day many Images which have all the outward parts and proportions of men to whoſe ſimilitude they are exactly formed. And perhaps you have heard of a Statue that walked and that ſpoke alſo, wherein the Artiſt indeavoured to expreſs the motions of inward life. Which may ſerve as a reſemblance to you of ſuch an Artificial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that not only the outſide and the garb of Piety is repreſented by it, but there is an imitation alſo of the inward motions of the ſoul in ſuch affections of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:101895:110"/>fear and love and joy as are in truly Religious hearts. Do not think it ſtrange nor wonder at this which I now tell you, for it is a very great truth which I thought not ſafe to conceal from you. And if you will have ſo much patience, I will diſcover to you the trick of it, and ſhow you by what mechanical powers this liveleſs Engine (for it is no better) is ſtirred and acted in the wayes of God.</p>
               <p>You know the force that Colours and Sounds and other ſuch material Objects have upon our ſenſes; and how they excite a great many motions in our animal ſpirits without aſking our leave or ſtaying for our conſent. You cannot be ignorant neither that theſe motions are in the ſoul it ſelf, which hath reſentments according to the quality of thoſe objects that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed withall. And again you cannot but perceive by my diſcourſe with you, that the figures and images of things may be raiſed in your fancy by that means, as well as conveighed by the doors of ſenſe. Suppoſe then that the beauty and lovelineſs of Chriſt were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to a company of men in very freſh colours and fair lineaments. That he was painted before their imagination by ſome ſweet-ton'd Orator as white and ruddy, the chiefeſt often thouſand. That this ſpeech of him ſhould be trim'd with nothing but gems and pretious ſtones, rayes and glories, odors and perfumes, crowns and diadems wherewith he ſaith this Prince of Glory and Woer of Souls is perpetually adorned. And then he ſhould tell them that his heart ſtands open to them, that he intends to lay them in his very boſome, that he would fain embrace them in his arms, and will waſh them in his blood, make them amiable and fair as well as himſelf, put upon them the robes of his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:101895:111"/>cover with his glorious garments to hide all their deformities, and ſo preſent them to God without ſpot or blemiſh that they may reign as ſo many Kings with him for ever. Suppoſe I ſay that ſuch a diſcourſe were made with much affection (and I believe you have ſometimes heard the like) would it not as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably move the imagination of a fleſhly man and be as apt to touch his heart with an inclination to this beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful perſon; as a lovely face preſented before the eyes doth give him a pleaſure and ſtirs up a paſſion in him toward it? Truly I nothing doubt but this picture of Chriſt might impreſs ſuch a conceit of him in the fancy, as might excite admiration, deſire, love, delight and ſuch other paſſions as ſhall be the imitation of thoſe that are in pious ſouls who are in love with the Vertues and Spirit of our Saviour. He may not at all ſuſpect but that he bears an affection to the Lord Jeſus, and in great zeal anathematize and curſe all thoſe who are not juſt affected like himſelf. He will condemn as much as your ſelf all thoſe dull and groſs ſouls who are imployed in ſetting the poſtures of the face, and amuſing the world with countenances. He laughs at them who are buſied in ordering the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the head, and bending the eyes to devotion. He is far above theſe actions of the body and feeling his ſoul in a devout poſture and toucht with Religious paſſions; he knows no reaſon why he ſhould not think himſelf to be worthy to wear the name of devout and Religious.</p>
               <p>And when theſe apprehenſions and emotions (as we call them) are once begotten, it is no hard matter to maintain and breed them up to a greater growth. They may be fed perpetually with new objects that yield
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:101895:111"/>a freſh delight. The deſcription of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> may be made ſo full of pleaſure, that an earthly man may be raviſhed therewith. And he hearing alſo certain ſigns and marks given of thoſe who are ſaid to have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, and ſhall be Heirs of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> it is very eaſie to conceive how ſuch a man may ſet himſelf a work, firſt to imprint his Fancy with ſuch Characters, and then to form his paſſions to ſome expreſſion and Apiſh imitation of them. Fancy, you know, hath a great command over all the paſſions, and being acquainted very well with the way to them, and the manner of awakening them, can call them forth upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as eaſily as upon any other. It can make them as buſie when theſe divine matters preſent themſelves, as when ſenſible objects knock at our doors, and demand to be admitted to our converſe. There are no names of dearneſs which men of this ſtamp cannot beſtow upon <hi>Jeſus.</hi> They can ſpeak of him with an high pleaſure: and pray in a pathetick ſtyle, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out devout tranſport. They find a Love to this kind of Communion with him. They can rejoyce to think of his fulneſs and ſufficiency. They can be aſtoniſhed at the freeneſs of his Grace. They can mourn for their ſins, and then call themſelves bleſſed for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Nay, more than this, they can excite the paſſion of gratitude in their hearts: and if they hear withall that they muſt be regenerate and born again, they can follow the Fancy of that ſo long, till they think that they feel the throws and pangs of the new birth, a change wrought in their ſouls, and all the reſt, in the method and order wherein they had it deſcribed to them. They will firſt be caſt down in great humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. They will complain of the naughtineſs of their hearts, and the corruptions of their natures. They
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:101895:112"/>will loathe and abhor themſelves as abominable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. They will diſclaim all their own righteouſneſs and ſtrength, and think of bringing their hearts to the Promiſe. And if they have heard any better language to expreſs this work, they will bring themſelves to an imitation of all that is contained in that alſo. They will labour to deteſt their former courſes, and to make a choice of a new life. They will ſtrain themſelves to ſpit upon their ſins, and to caſt a ſmile upon the wayes of Virtue. They will at leaſt offer themſelves to Chriſt to be formed anew, and pray him to make them ſuch as he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>Thus is one of the <hi>Religious Puppets</hi> of the world pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. This is the beginning and progreſs of that piece of work, which a good man now at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was wont to call a Mechanical Religion. And if you doubt at all whether or no there be ſuch an Artificial Device as this, which paſſes for Piety, do but call to mind one thing which you cannot but know if you have been a perſon of any obſervation, and you ſhall be convinced of it. There ariſes, you ſee, very often new modes and faſhions of Religion among us. The old wayes are much decryed, and the laſt invention is voted to be altogether Divine. Now if one of theſe perſons whom I have ſpoken of ſhall chance to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the acquaintance of a Sect, that is much different from the preſent which he hath long followed, you ſhal ſee him eaſily ſhift his form, and ſpeedily turn into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhape. He can ſoon quit the way wherein he was, and become religious after the manner of this novel plat-form. All the old ſigns and marks of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall ſtand for nothing, and now he diſtinguiſhes himſelf from the men of the world by other Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:101895:112"/>Which is an evident token that he is moved by the power of imagination, and as external objects ſhall ſtrongly impreſs themſelves: that he hath no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, but is carried by the impulſe of forein things, which change his motions at their pleaſure. He ſeems to himſelf to be alive, and to be no leſs than divinely acted; but alas! he is only a walking Ghoſt, as appears in this too plainly: That like thoſe Images of living Bodies, he can alter himſelf ſo quickly, and be moulded into another figure. Such a ſhadow of a Chriſtian, perhaps, was he that hath been the occaſion of all this diſcourſe: whom we are not to think to have an inward life becauſe of the noiſe and buſtle that he made, and the confidence wherewith he ſpake; for theſe do but ſtill render him more like thoſe Ghoſts, who have a greater boldneſs, and cauſe many times more ſtir, than they that are really alive.</p>
               <p>That we may be ſure therefore that you are a living man, you muſt expoſe your ſelf to our touch, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate it to the ſenſe of feeling. You muſt ſay as our Saviour did when his Diſciples took him for an Apparition, come near and handle me, and you ſhall ſee that I do not cheat you. Let thoſe that approach you perceive that Chriſt liveth in you, and <hi>ſhew forth your works out of a good converſation, and that in meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of wiſdom.</hi> I mean in plain words, that it muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the world, that you are a ſubſtantial Chriſtian by all the acts of an Holy Life. You muſt make them ſenſible of your exact Juſtice, your unfeigned Charity, your Self-denyal, your Patience, your Peaceableneſs, and above all, your Meekneſs, Humility and Modeſty of Spirit: that if they had a mind they may not have the face to ſay, you have but the ſemblance and Apiſh
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:101895:113"/>imitation of Piety. And to ſay the truth, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will certainly evince it to your ſelf, but only this, that you feel in your heart a conſtant, powerful, and prevailing inclination to all good works.<note place="margin">1 Joh 4.13</note>

It is a great while ago ſince a very eminent perſon told the world, that he noted but two ſmall wants in that ſort of men, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and of <hi>Love.</hi> He might have bated them one of the two, and yet their condition had been bad enough: though, if he had lived till now, he would have ſeen their Poverty increaſed, and that they want <hi>Humility</hi> as much as either of the other. They are indeed but ſmall wants in their account (eſpecially the two laſt of the three) and they can be very well content without them, if God will be ſo too. They eſteem themſelves Rich enough in other inviſible treaſures; nay, they have one Jewel of ſuch ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable value (<hi>viz.</hi> their <hi>Faith</hi>) that it will compenſate for a thouſand wants that are no greater than theſe.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:101895:113"/>But either I have loſt all my labour, or elſe I have made you ſenſible that there is nothing more imports you, than to ſee that you be not deficient in theſe two, <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Humility.</hi> I may ſafely, I ſuppoſe, refer you to your own memory for to be ſatisfied in their neceſſity; and ſo only ſay this concerning the former of them: That all your <hi>Faith</hi> is worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which worketh not by <hi>Love;</hi> and that he is a Lyer, who ſaith he Loveth God, and loveth not his Brother alſo.</p>
               <p>That you may ſecure your ſelf therefore the better from this, and all other illuſions, what other counſel ſhould I give you, than to ponder that ſentence much which I wiſht you to carry along with you, and to let your thoughts run as little as may be upon any other thing, ſave <hi>Jeſus</hi> only and <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> Draw your mind from the things which you ſee in this outward world, and make it to retire within unto your ſelf; that there you may talk with <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and behold <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and ſee that Glory where he is. Which when you have practiſed a competent time, as every thing will be unwelcome and painful to you, which is not related to them: So you will entertain every thing as very acceptable, which brings you into their familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.

               <head type="sub">Of the indeavours of his Enemies to keep him from doing good to his Brethren, under a pretence of Love to God. And of the Excellency of that Brotherly Charity.</head>
               <p>AND here it ſeems very ſeaſonable to remember you, of another common ſubtilty whereby your Adverſaries will ſtudy to deceive you, and put a great ſtop to your progreſs in the way you are about to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Which is, to detain you in the amuſements of contemplation, and to buſie your head only with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations and Conferences with <hi>Jeſus.</hi> They know that this will keep you too much at home, as well as any thing elſe, and that you will travel in your mind and thoughts only, but not with your whole man to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And therefore they will labour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you of this at leaſt, that there is not half ſo much Piety can be exerciſed abroad as in your Cloſet, and that the good we do our Brethren, is nothing comparable to the Meditations we have of God and our Saviour, and the Affections we expreſs unto them.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:101895:114"/>This will very much hinder your proficiency, and put a greater rub than you imagine in your way, if you lend any belief unto it. It will keep you very much behind, under the pretence and colour of putting you forward, and it will depreſs and thruſt you down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low others, while you ſeem to be mounting up on high, and ſoaring to a pitch far above them. For your Enemies underſtand very well, that God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts all that as done to himſelf, which is done to your Brethren for his ſake. He hath made over all thoſe benefits to them which are owing to him, becauſe he is in no need of them. They are become his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, and he hath devolved the right which he hath to our returns of Love to him, upon our Brethren. Be not you ignorant of this then, but underſtand it as well as your Enemies, that you never ſerve God bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor ſo well neither, as when you are doing any ſervice to your poor Neighbours. You are bound, you think, to expreſs ſuch Love to God, as he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to you. Only you find that he is not capable to receive ſuch effects of it, as you experiment in your ſelf from his affections to you. But will you imagine now, that he will loſe the right he hath to your thankful retributions, becauſe he is in want of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? No ſuch matter: he hath deputed thoſe who are in need to receive from us that which is due to him, and imploy it to their own uſes. He hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated (as I may ſay) all his claim to them, and bids them demand in his Name that which we cannot give, much leſs forgive to him. So that you exerciſe Juſtice and Charity both together, when you do good to your Neighbour; and there is a double Charity in it alſo, one to Him, and another to them. They have good done them upon his account, and he takes it ſo
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:101895:115"/>much as done to himſelf that he acknowledges an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, and binds himſelf to pay us again.</p>
               <p>Nay, let me tell you, that there is nothing in all the world can render you ſo divine and heavenly as to do much good. This puts us in the place of God to our poor Brethren to whom he ſends relief and help by our hands. Is not this a very high honour? And is not that a very noble quality which ſo differences us from all others, that it makes us like to the Moſt High? The Mechanical Chriſtian will here find himſelf to be dead and void of God; it being nothing but a Spirit of Life, and that very Divine too, which will carry us out of our ſelves, and fill us with perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ardors of Love to others, and inſtigate us to be doing of good to all. This is the very Character of the Deity, for <hi>God is Love, and he that loveth, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in God, and God in him.</hi> And therefore if you covet to excel all others, ſtudy to be indued with the moſt <hi>profitable Gifts,</hi> as the great Apoſtle advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: and yet, ſaith he, <hi>I ſhew you a more excellent way,</hi> and that is <hi>Charity.</hi> For this cauſes us to make uſe of all thoſe Gifts for the benefit of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. This is the rareſt way of excelling others, becauſe it makes us excell our ſelves, and likens us to God. The Angels, you know, had the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of being like to God in Power and Majeſty, aſpiring, as is conceived, to the Throne of the Moſt High. Our firſt Parents were ſoon infected with the like vanity, and they rubbed their Leproſie upon them, for they affected to reſemble God in wiſdom and knowledge. But by this means you know that both of them loſt what they enjoyed, inſtead of adding more unto it. What muſt we do then who ſee their
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:101895:115"/>falls? muſt we be content not to be like to our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor? Not ſo neither, but we muſt indeavour to imitate him in Love and Goodneſs, in which there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. <hi>This admits of no exceſs</hi> (as wiſe men obſerve) <hi>but only of error.</hi> We cannot love too much, though we may be imprudent in the communications of it. Though Angels and Men ſuffered ſo much by the deſire of other things in exceſs, yet in Charity there can be none, nor ſhall either of them ſuffer any damage by it. And therefore it was that God ſent his Son <hi>Jeſus</hi> into the world that by looking on him we may know how to become Divine. All his acts of power were acts of Love. All his Miracles were Mercies to men. He never imployed his Might but to do benefits. To teach us <hi>that they are truly great who are little in themſelves</hi> (as he was) <hi>and great in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. That they are indued with moſt power who can do moſt good: and that they are neareſt to God and moſt highly exalted, who are neareſt to their neighbours and moſt deeply humbled.</hi> You know that if a Circle be made, and you draw lines from the circumference to the middle point or Center where they all meet; the further theſe lines are in any place one from the other the farther they are from the Center; and the nearer they come to that, the nearer alſo and the clofer their approaches are to each other. This may be a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance if you pleaſe of our condition here in this World, where we are all in our way to God the Center of our Reſt, and travelling to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> where we hope to meet in him. We are deſirous now to draw as nigh to him as we can, and many fancy that their muſings, meditations and prayers, are the chiefeſt if not the only things that bring them near unto him. But as I have told you heretofore ſo let me now repeat
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:101895:116"/>it again, That God and our Brethren are ſo inſeperable that we cannot touch the one but we muſt be joyned to the other alſo. The further any of us is removed from his neighbour (as you ſee in that ſimilitude) at the greater diſtance he is from God. He cannot go away from the former, but he goes away in the ſame proportions from the latter too. And the nearer and cloſer he is joyned in the affection of Charity to his neighbour, the nearer he is unto God, the more doth he approach to his excellencies, and to an union with him. If you will be a follower of God then as a dear child of his, <hi>Walk in love.</hi> You cannot chuſe ſure to do otherwiſe when you have ſo glorious a pattern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you. It is an honourable thing now you ſee to love, ſince God himſelf is become a Lover. You may have imagined perhaps that ſome offices of Charity are ignoble and diſparage a perſon of honour: As moſt men of condition think it below them to go into a poor mans houſe, to come near the ſtinking wounds and the dirty beds of the meaner ſort: and there are very few who do not account it a ſneaking quality to put up injuries and paſs by affronts. But you cannot be of this mind if you look upon God who by loving us hath alſo taught us how honourable and glorious all theſe things are. They are not below us ſince they are not below himſelf. There is no man ſo much our inferiour, as we are all beneath Him. And yet he condeſcended to them. He comes and dwells in this periſhing fleſh of ours. He deſpiſes not our poor cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages: he dreſſes our wounds: he takes care of our ſores: he heals our ſickneſſes, he paſſes by our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions; yea, he prayes us to be friends, and intreats us to be reconciled. And that is a thing which men think to be ſo poor and mean that no great ſpirit can
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:101895:116"/>indure to ſubmit unto it. To go to others who have offended us and beſeech them to lay aſide their enmity is thought to ſavour of baſeneſs and to be an argument of a low and cowardly mind. But God will give us leave to think ſo no longer. He hath ſhown us that it is the effect of a moſt generous and noble diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo far from being a blemiſh to us that we ſhould glory in it to be the firſt in making peace and offering terms of reconciliation. Others may think to give proofs of their gallantry by ſtanding in defiance to all thoſe who will not ſubmit themſelves and lye at their feet; yea by trampling on them who ſhall in the leaſt offend them: but God teaches us by his own example that there is no greater height of mind, then in Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Meekneſs to condeſcend to others, yea to lay our ſelves at their feet and beg of them for the ſake of the Lord of Peace that they will be the children of Peace. This is to become the ſons of the moſt High and heirs of the greateſt Glory.</p>
               <p>And now let me aſk you for what end would you ſhut up your ſelf in your Cloſet, or make a Cell of your houſe? Is it not that you may improve your ſelf in the knowledge of God; and do you not hope there to converſe more with Heaven? you need not then be put to the trouble of this confinement, for I aſſure you nothing will ſo much promote your end as Love of your neighbour. This will make you feel what God is and give you the cleareſt and ſtrongeſt ſenſe of him. And the larger and wider your Charity grows, the more able will you be to conceive the vaſtneſs of Gods Love, and the leſs doubt you will have of his Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal good will. It will diſpoſe you alſo more then any thing elſe to believe the Goſpel, and will win your
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:101895:117"/>aſſent to thoſe reports which ſeem moſt incredible. When you find in your ſelf ſuch a great loye to others, it will be eaſier for you to conclude that God might love us ſo much as to ſend his only Son into the World, and give him alſo to dye for us ſinners. And if there be any thing of greater force then other to bring you acquainted with the joy and peace of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to make diſcoveries beforehand of it, this muſt be that happy Spy. For they conſiſt very much in the dear love and friendſhip which there is between all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of that bleſſed place. But theſe things I will leave to your own thoughts and only pray you to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy your mind in all your ſecret retirements ſo much in theſe meditations, that you may iſſue forth from thence very full of God, and as a man inſpired to do much good. For this active devotion is that which God loves. He will impart more of his bleſſings to you if you open your hands in doing benefits to others, then if you ſhould lift them up all day in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers to Heaven. He refuſes nothing to the ſtirring and diligent ſouls, whom love and good-will have ſet in motion. He delights to give to thoſe who imploy his Grace. It is a pleaſure to him to bleſs thoſe who go forth to meet his favours and do not expect them in their Chambers. But we never imploy his Grace bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then when we imitate the effuſions of it upon us in our kindneſs and benignity to others. And we are never more like to meet his bleſſings, then when they are bleſſing of him for the good that we have brought unto them.</p>
               <p>I know you will be ready to ſay hereafter, that you can deſign a great deal more, than you doubt you ſhall ever do. That the Idaea you have of this Noble
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:101895:117"/>quality is very high, but you are affraid it is above your reach. And therefore I pray you before hand that you would not trouble your ſelf with ſuch thoughts, but only remember theſe two things. That when you have done all the good that ever you can, that will diſpoſe you ſtill to do more: and in the mean ſeaſon you are to take care of this, to rejoyce heartily that there are others in the World who can do more good then you. If we were once arrived at this noble diſpoſition of rejoycing in the good of others, either in that which they enjoy, or that which they can do, we ſhould be ſo far from wanting Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that we ſhould equal our ſelves with the moſt excellent and bleſſed natures. As we ſhould have no cauſe to complain that we are not in the ſame throne with Princes, nor to envy the learning of thoſe who ſit in the Chairs of Wiſdom: ſo we ſhould not come behind the devotion of the greateſt Saints, nor be much inferiour to the Angels, who think it no ſmall part of their happineſs that they can rejoyce in God and in all the marks of his goodneſs whereſoever they can diſcern them. Are we leſs happy becauſe our Wit is not ſo ſtrong, our revenues not ſo large, our ſtation not ſo high, and ſo our power to oblige others not ſo great as thoſe of many of our neighbours? No ſuch thing, but we ſhall rather be the more happy if in the midſt of a low condition and in a meaner rank, we can keep our ſelves from the ruſt and canker of envy which is wont to grow ſooneſt in ſuch places as are low and damp. He hath raiſed himſelf to a very high pitch whoſe ſoul ſurmounts all diſcouragements and rejoyces in the Univerſal good of mankind by whomſoever it is procured. Hereby we ſhall make the happineſs of every perſon that is above us to be our own. For how
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:101895:118"/>is he more Happy then I who gets a victory, if I tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in it as much as himſelf? Wherein is he Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to me whoſe riches increaſe, if I be not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented therewith, but much better pleaſed in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous eſtate then I was before he injoy'd it? Nay, if it make me well, to ſee him in health, and refreſh my ſpirit, to ſee him merry, and really render me bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to behold his progreſs in wiſdom and vertue; then I have the benefit of all theſe, and they become mine as much as his in whom they are. And can you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive a better way then this to make your ſoul the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort of all pleaſures; the very Center wherein the happineſs of the whole world ſhall meet, the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouz (if you will give leave to that word) of all thoſe joyes which are ſcattered every where among Gods creatures? It is not poſſible for you to do it: nor is there any delight ſo noble and ſublime, ſo pure and refined as this that with ſo much eaſe you may enjoy. It is the very extract of all other pleaſures; it is the Eſſence and Spirit of them without the groſſer parts, which are wont to detain half of the pleaſure from us. Though other pleaſures make more noiſe, yet this gives greater contentment. They make a louder ſound, but the commendation of this is its ſilence and quiet. The world takes more notice of others but the very ſecrecy of this joy increaſes its ſweetneſs, and vapours not out the purity thereof. Other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments may be greater in bulk, but this is more in value. They are obtained at a great charge, but this we injoy at other mens coſt. Thoſe perſons have the labour and ſweat together with their delight, and we have the pure pleaſure. They work not for themſelves only, but they muſt do us ſome ſervice thereby. We come in for a ſhare of all their gettings,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:101895:118"/>and want nothing which they have, but only the toil and the pains. And yet ſo innocent is this pleaſure, that while we enjoy all that others do we leave them all they had and take nothing away from them. As the Bees ſuck an inviſible ſweetneſs, which robs the Flowers of none of their beauties from whence they fetch it: So do we when we ſolace our ſelves in other mens goods; which are not impaired by our relliſhies nor made leſs by all the contentment we draw from them. Nay we oblige them by this means, and pay them largely for all that we take. It will be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to their pleaſures to know that others are pleaſed with them. It will be the beſt part of their ſatisfaction to underſtand that you caſt not an evil eye upon their enjoyments. Their happineſs would be imperfect, if you did not think your ſelf happy too. They will owe as much to you as to their own acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and you equal your ſelf to them by not envying their ſuperiority.</p>
               <p>But I think it is time to conclude this diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the good you are to do your Brethren; and therefore I ſhall only admoniſh you of a thing which may be apt, if you have not conſidered it, to trouble you in your way to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and ſo paſs to other matters. After you have done all the good you can, you muſt not think to have the pleaſure of finding all theſe perſons grateful on whom you have beſtowed your favours. You muſt rejoyce in your own Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, without expecting that additional delight which reciprocal love would afford you. Such a good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I believe as yours will make you ſuppoſe that you have received a favour when one hath but done you juſtice, and therefore you will be infinitely ſenfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:101895:119"/>of any kindneſs, and think that it layes an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obligation of gratitude upon you. But do not imagine that you ſhall meet with much of this inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity in the World: There are a far greater number of ſuch a wicked diſpoſition, that they look even upon kindneſſes as their due, and will render you no more thanks for them, then men commonly do for Juſtice to which every body claims an equal right. Nay you will meet with thoſe who when they are highly obliged, do love to avoid the perſons that put thoſe bonds upon them. They will not behave themſelves ſo well as to take your kindneſſes for their due, but carry it rather as if you had done them a ſenſible wrong. And I wiſh I could not ſay that there are ſuch ill natures who cannot indure ſo much as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thoſe who have been their benefactors, but ſhun them as if they were their deadly enemies. But you will find I fear too many of theſe wretches, who think whenſoever they ſee you that you upbraid them with al the good they have received from you. When you did them benefits you laid chains upon them, and they think it no crime to hate him that hath made them his Priſoners. They will heartily wiſh you were dead, that ſo they may be freed from their bonds which will dye and be buried in the ſame grave together with you. For they, meaſuring other mens natures by their own evil diſpoſition, which inclines them to do good to none, unleſs it be with a deſign to make them ſlaves; they could wiſh never to ſee thoſe perſons, who they think, look upon themſelves as their Lords and Maſters, by having thus engaged them. Their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies are meer traffique, and they alwayes expect to gain more than they give: which makes them hate their benefactors, who look they imagine for payment
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:101895:119"/>alſo far greater than they have a will to make. Nay, they had rather do a courteſie to thoſe who never did any thing for them, than be officious to thoſe perſons who have ſo much obliged them. Juſt like thoſe wicked people who had rather make a preſent to others, than pay what they owe to their Creditors. Which, to ſay the truth, is no more than the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry confequence of that curſed principle I named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of trading with kindneſſes, and putting them out to Uſe, that they may improve into greater, to be rendred back to them. I know very well there is no vice more odious than this, or which lyes under grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reproach even by ungrateful perſons themſelves; but yet I aſſure you, it will be found that there is none more common. And the miſchief of it is, that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo likely to grow in baſe natures, as when they have been highly bound to you. The kinder you have been, the more ungrateful they are like to prove: like thoſe, who having contracted a vaſt debt, and having little to pay, run away with ſhame, and pay juſt nothing at all. You muſt do good therefore meerly for the Love you bear to it ſelf; and though you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire no payment but only the pleaſure of having it kindly reſented, you muſt be content ſometimes to loſe that ſmall return, and reſt ſatified in what you have done, and in your pious diſpoſition to do the ſame again.</p>

               <head type="sub">That a <hi>Pilgrim</hi> muſt ſometimes recreate himſelf as well as other men. Of the pleaſure of good Company. What Men are to be more particularly avoided. Of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals of the Church. How uſeful they may be. And how much abuſed.</head>
               <p>AND now I think it is time to remember you for the prevention of all miſtakes, that there never was any <hi>Pilgrim</hi> who could alwayes be exerciſed in doing good to others, or in Prayer and Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but he was forced to attend ſometimes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone, and provide for the needs of his Body by the uſe of Meat, and Drink, and Sleep; wherein you muſt not think to be unlike them. Nay, there is a great need alſo at certain ſeaſons of innocent Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which <hi>Pilgrims</hi> muſt not be ſo moroſe as utterly to deny themſeles; for in truth there are none ſo fit as they to enjoy them. And in all theſe things I would have you to uſe the beſt diſcretion that is in your power, avoiding, as you would the greateſt danger that hath been mentioned, all fooliſh ſcrupuloſity about them. Do not meaſure your Drink, nor weigh your Meat, nor confine your Divertiſements to a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, but enjoy them freely as the beſt wiſdom you have ſhall at that preſent direct you, reſolving not to trouble your ſelf about any after accidents. For, though it is neceſſary that we take a care to ſpend our time well, and there is nothing of which we ſhould be more frugal; yet it is not good to be over rigorous in exacting an account of our hours. We may run our
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:101895:120"/>ſelves thereby into infinite ſcruples, and buſie our thoughts about ſuch endleſs niceties, that we may loſe much time while we are thinking how to ſave it, and impoveriſh our ſelves by ſtudying to be miſerable good huſbands. Do not grudge therefore to theſe things a fair portion of your time, out of a fear that they will be too great an hinderance to you; for though they ſeem to ſtay you for a while, they do very much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you, and give you ſtrength to walk more careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a long time after. Diſcreet ſtayes and reſts make ſpeedy journeys. It is no turning out of your way, to divert your ſelf ſometime in a pleaſant Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. That is the neareſt way to a place, which brings you ſooneſt thither. And as the old ſaying is, ſoft and fair, goes far.</p>
               <p>And indeed it is impoſſible that all the hours of a mans life ſhould be equally grave. The wings of the ſoul cannot be alwayes ſtretched, and it is idle to think its vigor ſhall receive no abatements. Let it ſoar ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo high, it will be forc'd to ſtoop again; and by ſitting ſtill, and refreſhing it ſelf, be made more able for a new flight. Of this you muſt be well adviſed, or elſe you will never get to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> It is the counſel of nature which muſt be followed, that all who work, do take ſome reſt. The continuance of labour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon Moderation, and Nature alwayes threatens violence with an end. I grant that your deſires may be ever pricking you forward, and that they may be loath to give you a moments reſt. But they will ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate you even till they gall you, and if you take not heed, will make you reſt of neceſſity, and not out of choice. The beſt courſer that is may run himſelf off his leggs. You may tyre and jade your ſelf by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:101895:121"/>journeys. And though your mind be of ſuch a make, that if it were alone, and had nothing to carry along with it, poſſibly it might never be weary, but would run continually: yet while it is ingaged in the company of this terreſtrial body, it muſt ſit ſtill and eaſe it ſelf, if it be but for the ſake of its fellow-traveller. We are not yet divorced from ſenſe, nor do we enjoy the liberty which we hope for at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> We are far from the purity of ſimple Beings, and whether we will or no, ſhall find our ſelves to be mixt with matter, which will not alwaies move. It will be a ſlugg do what we can: and if we will not find it ſome refreſhment, it will take ſome of it ſelf, and more ſometimes than we need to give it. It is better that it ſhould be at our diſpoſe, than at its own. It will be content with leſs, if we do not deny it all. We ſhall find it more obedient if we do not by our rigour provoke it to a plain rebellion. We ſhall uſe greater Moderation, if by defrauding our ſelves of all recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we do not become ſo impatient as to play the gluttons, when we take the liberty to enjoy them. It is, no doubt, a true obſervation, That the ready way to make the minds of youth grow awry, is to lace them too hard, by denying them their juſt freedom. When you rob the appetite of its lawful and innocent delight, it hath ſuch a deſire to break this Priſon, that it oft-times furiouſly burſts forth into unlawful and forbidden pleaſures. And therefore uſe a due care at leaſt in your firſt ſetting out, that you run not with too great a violence. Do not make more haſte than good ſpeed, as you will be apt to do when you begin your journey. Young <hi>Pilgrims</hi> are wont to be very forward, and to tye themſelves to ſuch long ſtages; that they grow weary, and turn aſide to ſome more
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:101895:121"/>pleaſing courſes. And it is well if they divert not to ſuch as are looſe after too great ſtrictneſs. They are very happy if they leave not off their travel, by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling too faſt. The very beſt that we can expect, is that they ſit down as men out of breath, and that they loſe more time in recovering of it, than they would have done in ſeaſonable refreſhments.</p>
               <p>Nay, let me tell you, the oldeſt traveller upon the Rode will find that he hath great uſe of them, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give ſo good an account of his time, unleſs he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow a little of it upon them. Recreations are part of the needs of humane life, and though a man be never ſo well provided, he will be liable to this want. The moſt vigorous minds will ſometimes be weary, and call for quiet and eaſe. The ſtrongeſt eyes will at laſt grow weak, and deſire to ſhut themſelves <hi>The life of the greateſt Sages</hi> (as a wiſe man once told me) <hi>is not altogether ſerious. All their ſayings are not Sermons: nor is all they write either their laſt Teſtament, or the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Faith.</hi> And therefore ſtudy not how to live and uſe none, but rather to uſe none but thoſe which are good and worthy of a man. Think not to be employed ſo as not to need them, but take care that under a pretence of need they do not become your em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. Order the matter ſo diſcreetly that they may be as profitable as they are delightful. See that they render you the hours back again which you have beſtowed on them. For there is nothing more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain than that <hi>we may gain time by intermitting our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and rid the more ground by ſtanding ſtill a while.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And becauſe the greateſt part of a wiſe mans plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure conſiſts in good diverting company, let me here
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:101895:122"/>remember you to provide that it be carefully choſen, and that you do not lightly take men into your fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity. Excellent men you are rather to be converſant withall, than excellent Books. You may learn more of them than all your ſtudy can teach you. You may at once give your ſoul a recreation, and your body a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt: You may divert your ſelf and others both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. He who asks and enquires of his company, ſhall both receive much learning, and give much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: eſpecially when his queſtions are addreſſed to ſuch whoſe ſkill lyes in that whereof he demands ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. For then he offers them a fit occaſion to pleaſe themſelves in ſpeaking, and he gains much knowledge himſelf by being poſſeſſed of their concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And therefore it is moſt adviſable for you to frequent the ſociety of thoſe who have more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge than your ſelf. Though there are who affect the company of ignorant perſons, that ſo they may be taken for knowing men; yet they who are really knowing, ſeek for the wiſe, that ſo they may know more. In the one you may be admired, but in the other you ſhall be acquainted with things that are worthy of admiration. And I beſeech you, which is better, to learn wiſdom from thoſe who are wiſe, or to be accounted wiſe by thoſe who are ignorant? It is a pittiful thing, in my judgment, to be thought wiſe when you are not: and yet it is ſtill more deplorable when you pleaſe your ſelf in being ſo thought by thoſe who indeed are very fools. If you would win the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Wiſdom, let it be with thoſe who know what it is. But you muſt firſt have it, before you have their eſteem; and the firſt ſtep to it, is to be ſo wiſe as to know in what company it is to be learnt.</p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:101895:122"/>
               <p>But it is not my intention to make you a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on this ſubject; and therefore I ſhall not warn you of all thoſe who are to be avoided, but only of one ſort who will more abuſe your time, and alſo do you greater miſchief than any elſe beſide that are not openly wicked. They that I mean are a talkative ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, who are ever chattering and babling as if they had obtained a Pattent for prating. People that are ſo much in company with others, that they can never find leiſure to keep any with themſelves. Who are a burden to themſelves when they are at home, and to their neighbours when they are abroad. Whoſe minds are ſtuft with nothing but News, of which they are ſo full, that they have no room for one wiſe thought to lodge there. But above all others, I would have you mark and ſhun a complaining ſort of people who are ever finding fault, and never can be pleaſed. Their minds feed upon the ſins or the harms of others, and they have alwayes ſome News to make you ſad. The ſubject of their diſcourſe moſt commonly is, the evil of the dayes wherein they live. They alwayes praiſe that which is paſt, and diſcommend that which is preſent. The wiſe men of former dayes they are ever magnifying: and they will allow no body to be good, but thoſe who are dead. They ſeek for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Piety in the Acts and Monuments of the Church, which they would not follow nor applaud if they were alive again. Nay, they have in great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration all that is done abroad, but are ill-affected to all that is done at home. Nothing can be ſo well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, but they will ſhew you ſome errour in it: nor can there be ſo profound a peace, but they will fright you with ſome thing that portends Wars, or other Calamities. They never look upon the Kingdom
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:101895:123"/>where they live, but they ſee it full of the tokens of Gods wrath. There is no ſpot that can appear, but they make it a mark of the plagues of Heaven that are coming upon us. They have loſt their taſte and judgment through the gall and bitterneſs of their own heart. Their choler overflows ſo much, that they have no ſenſe or relliſh of any of Gods mercies, but cry out perpetually of woes and miſeries. One would think by their talk, that the tranquillity of their Country is a trouble to them, and rather than have no diſturbance, they will begin it in themſelves. Nay, let things be in what poſture they will, you ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find them at any eaſe. Let them change their faces never ſo much, they ſtill retain the ſame ſad countenance, and follow you with their complaints. If all things be in a proſperous eſtate, they fill you with fears of the evils that are to come. And if the times be very miſerable, then they bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the happineſs which they could not ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the dayes that are paſt. When they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay, they will give you a very grave nod, by which you muſt gather, their heads are full, if their wiſdom thought it fit at that time to empty them. And when they are afraid to ſpeak their thoughts, then they will ſhake their head, and give a terrible ſhrug, as if all were nought and going to ruine. In ſhort, you ſhall hear theſe men ſpeak nothing but <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations:</hi> and they will mix their words with ſuch ſighs, that you would think they layd to heart the badneſs of the times. But do not believe them: this may be no more but a copy of their countenance. For there are a number of them who conceive a ſecret joy when they hear an ill ſtory of one whom they hate: and could not tell how to appear good, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:101895:123"/>they had ſome mens vices to ſpeak againſt. They would not be able to live, if all men ſhould leave their ſins. There would not be found a man ſo bad as they, if all ſhould become ſo good as they ſeem to deſire. They would be more troubled at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, than they are at the diſorders. And, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs their hearts were changed, they muſt either then be dumb, or elſe make faults where they could find none. And that is a matter, I aſſure you, very eaſie for them to do. For they never regard whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their complaints be juſt or unjuſt: and it would be to ſuppoſe them too reaſonable, if we ſhould think they are never diſcontented without a cauſe. Mingle not your ſelf therefore with ſuch men: but judge it better a great deal to travel alone, than to fall into ſuch company. If you mean to finiſh your journey, ſtay not to liſten to their tales, for they have no end, and they will detain you with them for ever. There is no thing, no perſon can eſcape the ſcourge of their tongues; and fince thoſe are innumerable, ſo are their ſtories.</p>
               <p>But in this and all the foregoing Directions which I have given you, it will be of great uſe to mark the footſteps which you will meet withall of many Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers who have gone before you. Some of the Prints of their feet you will find bigger, and others of them leſs then your own; but all of them will ſo incourage you, and excite you, and ſupply the place of a Guide unto you, that I may leave the reſt to their inſtructions. And indeed the wiſedome of the ancient Church ſeems herein to have been very great, who choſe to honour the dayes of relaxation and intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of labours with the names of the Apoſtles and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:101895:124"/>Saints of God. It is fit as I ſaid that we ſhould ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſe recreations, but they would teach us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and end them with acknowledgements of God. It is neceſſary that we chear our ſpirits and refreſh our minds, but we muſt ſtill remember that there is no greater pleaſure then to praiſe our Lord. When we divert our ſelves we ſhould have the example of brave men before us. In all our Sports and Mirth, there muſt nothing be admitted which is unbecomeing the gravity and purity of good Chriſtians. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let me intreat you on all the Feſtivals of the Saints to ſeaſon your mind in the morning with the meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their holy lives. When you keep the dayes which preſerve their memory, be ſure to follow their vertues which in effect will make them ſtill to live in the World. It is a ridiculous thing to bleſs God for thoſe examples which we never mean to imitate. It is monſtrouſly abſurd to maintain the memory of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mens names, with an utter forgetfulneſs of their Piety. If they be capable of any grief in the bleſſed place where they now are, and have carried their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions away with them to the other World; it makes them ſigh one would think to ſee the lewdneſs of thoſe that honour them, and the diſgrace that is done to Religion under the countenance of their great names. It wounds them ſure to hear themſelves commended laviſhly, and to ſee their lives reproached as guilty of too much ſeverity. It was an odd ſaying, but ſpoken with much ſimplicity and zeal by an old Preacher, That he wondred the Saints did not riſe out of their graves to drive thoſe away from their Temples, who uſe ſo much ceremony in celebrating their Feſtivals, and take ſo little care to follow their Vertues. But I may rather wonder with what face men can ſpeak
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:101895:124"/>againſt thoſe who neglect the obſervance of theſe Dayes, when they themſelves are the chiefeſt cauſe of it, or the beſt colour for it. They diſhonour all holy rites, and bring a reproach upon holy times: and if it had not been for ſuch as them, thoſe dayes might have been in more credit, even with thoſe who now deſpiſe them. What do we ſee ſay thoſe ſcrupulous perſons but riot and luxury at ſuch ſeaſons? All places are full of vomit and men ſeem to be celebrating the Feaſt of <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus, i. e.</hi> of Bread and Wine, of ſome heatheniſh, drunken belly-god. They fancy there is no reſtraint layd upon their appetite, if they do but ſtrictly forbear their ordinary labours. They are like ſome bad Chriſtians in the old times, who made no doubt of being drunk, ſo they did but take off their cups as they ſate on the Martyrs Tombs. It is eaſie indeed for theſe objectors to ſee ſomething elſe: They might behold ſome devout people who frequent the Worſhip of God and rejoyce moſt in remembring their Saviour and his great Grace in ſending thoſe that Preached the Goſpel to the World. But the number of the other are ſo great who never regard ſuch things, that by looking on them they are tempted to take no notice of all the reſt. The Taverns are fuller by far then our Churches; and the Theatre is more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented then the Houſe of God. And therefore it is for ſuch as you to ſet your ſelves a work to take away this objection which they will not take away them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Do you ſatisfie them that theſe dayes are no neceſſary cauſe of doing evil, by your own example of doing good. Leave their Argument no force at all, for it is in your power to do it: and let them ſee that the marriage between theſe Feſtivals and Profaneneſs is not ſo legitimate, but they may be divorced. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:101895:125"/>them of this colour and leave their peeviſhneſs ſo naked that it may be expoſed to the view of all. Or if they have taken a real offence, remove it out of their way and let all that they alledg have a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation in your holy life. Anſwer them by your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, that there is no need to take away theſe dayes, for you can take away all the wickedneſs and leave them ſtill remaining. Let them ſee that you can reſt from your labours and yet not ſpend your whole time in ſport and play. Let them find the Bible or ſome good book in your hand oftner then they do the Cards. Let your Spirit rejoyce in God your Saviour, more then your body doth in meat and drink. Feed your ſoul upon the Heavenly myſteries of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and do not live as if the Saints were only good Purveyors for our Kitchins. So will you both bring theſe dayes into eſteem with others, and your ſelf into greater favour with God. And I beſeech you, deſire all you know that they would not ſleight ſuch admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions as theſe I give you: But that for the Honour of our Lord, for the credit of his Church who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed theſe ſolemnities, for the love of their own ſouls who are intended to receive the benefit of them, they would behave themſelves ſoberly and religiouſly at ſuch ſeaſons. That ſo the Church may not be forced to do with theſe as it hath done with the Feaſts of Love and other rites uſed by the Apoſtles themſelves, <hi>i. e.</hi> aboliſh and baniſh them becauſe of mens obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate abuſe of them. For <hi>it is a very abſurd thing,</hi> (as one of the ancient Guides ſaith) <hi>to ſtudy to honour the Martyrs with too much fulneſs, who we know pleaſed God by faſting and abſtinence.</hi> It is a proſperous way of doing honour to our Saviour, by pampering and pleaſing our ſelves; who it is known did honour his
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:101895:125"/>Father by denying himſelf and deſpiſing all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the fleſh. Therefore exhort every one to feaſt themſelves with an holy fear. Let them make Feaſts of Charity and doing good to their poor neighbours. Let them be Feaſts of Love to make us friends one with another. Feaſts of the Spirit to put us in mind of the joyes of the Lord and the eternal Supper of the Lamb.</p>
               <p>And now I think I may have leave to conclude my directions (having put you into the hands of better Guides then my ſelf) the ſum whereof is briefly this: Let your principal deſign ever be to knit your heart to the Love of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and the ardent deſire of being with him at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Let this be your great buſineſs to ſet your. Soul directly towards the place where he is, and to ſtir up in it ſuch longings as theſe, <hi>O that I were with Jeſus! when ſhall I come to Jeſus!</hi> And ſince he is the Way to himſelf there is nothing more needful for the accompliſhing your deſire then to propoſe him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyes for your imitation. As for <hi>Prayer, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,</hi> and ſuch like things, they are to be deſigned to this end, that your Love to him may be inflamed, your Deſire after him increaſed, and your Reſolution of doing his will and treading in his ſteps be made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable. Whatſoever therefore you find proper to advance that Love, that Deſire, that Reſolution, be it <hi>Praying</hi> or <hi>Reading, Diſcourſing</hi> or <hi>Solitude, Walking</hi> or <hi>Repoſing your ſelf, Viſiting of others,</hi> or <hi>Keeping at home;</hi> make uſe of it for the time that your Soul relliſhes it, and as long as it quickens your Deſire and indeavour of enjoying the love of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and the bleſſed ſight of him at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But when any of theſe ſhall prove irkſome to you, be not troubled at it, but try for that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:101895:126"/>time ſome of the reſt, which may be then more uſeful becauſe more pleaſant to you. And when any of thoſe Enemies I have mentioned ſhall diſturb your peace, beat them off as ſoon as you can; but be not troubled becauſe they do not preſently yield, provided you do not yield to them neither. And if after a Victory they rally in the ſame manner again, be not affrighted at that neither, as if now they had greater courage; but endeavour only to beat them as before, and by obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new Victory to ſhow that it is your courage which is increaſed. And do not think you ſhall be in danger to loſe the Victory over them, if you ſuffer your Bow ſometimes to be unbent. Do not think a Pilgrim muſt be ſo ſevere as never to recreate himſelf in the way he goes. By perpetual Watchings and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours your enemies may undo you as well as by any other means. Take but heed that you fall not into their Quarters when you divert your ſelf, and let but your pleaſures ſtill lye in your way, and you need not fear to make uſe of them. Remember the Example of the Saints of God, and ſtir up your ſelf to imitate their zeal and their diſcretion both together. And reſt aſſured (my Friend) that this good Deſire thus cheriſhed, thus augmented, and thus ſtrongly and wiſely purſued, will bring you ſafe to the end of your Pilgrimage; and ſet your feet in the midſt of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> where I ſhall be right glad to meet you.</p>

               <head type="sub">What entertainment all theſe diſcourſes met withall from the Pilgrim. And of the pleaſures he ſhould find in his way, though incumbred with the fore-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Enemies.</head>
               <p>AND now I am ſure you will expect to hear that the Pilgrim broke his ſilence: If not to thank this perſon for the ſatisfaction he had received, yet to tell him how much he thought himſelf engaged by the pains which he had moſt friendly taken for his ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the way to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But yet he could not for the preſent ſpeak ſo much as one Word; ſuch a violent paſſion ſeizing on him that it blockt up all other paſſages but only thoſe for Tears. Which guſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out apace and ſeeking for more vent then they could find; cauſed a greater obſtruction, and were ready to choak not only his Words, but alſo Himſelf. The good man who had hitherto been his Guide, thought that now he muſt become his Phyſitian. And fearing that this paſſion might grow to ſome danger, and ſuſpecting withall that it was the effect of a great ſadneſs which he had conceived at his diſcourſe; He went to him and taking him by the hand intreated him to reſiſt this tide ſo long, till he could take ſo much breath as to tell him the cauſe of it. Now that the <hi>Pilgrim</hi> might ſhow how obedient he was like to prove to the reſt of his Words, he ſtrove ſo earneſtly with himſelf, that many Minutes were not paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he recovered the uſe of his tongue and was able thus to ſpeak to him. You have obliged me Sir ſo
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:101895:127"/>much beyond all my expreſſion by the Inſtructions you have beſtowed upon me, that as an endeavour to do more then we can, doth frequently make us to do juſt nothing at all; ſo I felt enough from thence ariſing to ſtifle my words, while my Soul laboured ſuch expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Gratitude as could not be uttered. My Tears Sir could only tell you how much I think my ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to your Charity. For they did not ſpring from Grief as perhaps you might imagine, but from a very great joy, which flowed partly from the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Providence which brought me hither, and partly from the ſenſe of your friendly love, but chiefly from the good news you tell me, that the way to ſuch a Bleſſed place as <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is incumbred with no greater difficulties then you have related. O Sir I am overjoyed to hear that the journey will be no worſe. It is a beginning of the pleaſures I expect there, to know that the way is ſo good; for I was willing to have undertaken far greater things, rather then forſake my reſolution of going thither. And here his voyce was intercepted by a new paſſion like to the former, though it was not long before it had ſpent it ſelf and gave him liberty to utter his mind as freely as he pleaſed.</p>
               <p>But before he could begin to diſcharge himſelf of thoſe thoughts with which his Soul ſeemed to be fill'd, the other prevented him and told him that it was no ſmall joy to him alſo to find himſelf ſo deceived and to meet with ſuch a flood of joy in that place, where he feared he ſhould have found a deluge of ſorrow. And ſince, ſaid he, you take ſo great content in what I have ſaid about the way to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which others hear with as much heavineſs as you did with pleaſure; I
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:101895:127"/>ſhall give you a freſh addition of joy by ſomething elſe which I reſerved as an incouragement to you, but now I ſee muſt be a part of your comfort. And truly by what I ſhall ſay, you will plainly ſee how well <hi>Jeſus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his ſervants that are willing to obey him; giving them far more than they durſt expect, and where they lookt for nothing but trouble and anguiſh, cauſing joy and gladneſs to ſpring up unto them. You ſhall never meet, I am confident, with worſe entertainments, than I have mentioned in your way to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> unleſs it be <hi>Death</hi> which we may meet with every where. But far better than have been ſpoken of, I do not fear to promiſe, if the Directions be followed which have been delivered to you. For beſides the pleaſures that will attend all your Victories, which are indeed unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and more than can be numbred; I muſt tell you there is much contentment to be fetcht from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the way you are to go. Though in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places it may be rugged and hard, as you already perceive, yet it is alwayes very ſtraight and eaſie to hit, having none of thoſe windings and turnings in it that perplex and intricate men in the contrary paths; which, me-thinks, is no ſmall comfort to a Traveller. Do you not ſee how many thouſand Arts men are at the labour to deviſe that they may cheat and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their neighbours? What a number of ſhifts they are put unto to make good a lye, and to palliate a piece of knavery? What a loſs they are at ſometimes to compaſs their revenge, or to ſatisfie an unchaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire? And what a vaſt burden of cares they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted withall who do not depend on God? What troubleſome thoughts, what fears and frights, what diſcontents and diſguſts, and ſuch like paſſions as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb their quiet they are continually peſtered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all?
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:101895:128"/>There is none can tell you how theſe men wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up and down, and are at their wits end, and when one way fails, are put with as much incertainty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe a new, to attain that which they deſign. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the wayes wherein I would lead you are ſimple and plain, and lye ſo openly before your eyes, that you need not ſtudy what you have to do. Every body may ſoon know what Juſtice is, and there needs no Art at all to define it. To live purely, to forgive ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to truſt in God, and to ſpeak the truth, are things of no intricacy, and will not torture your mind for one moment to know what belongs unto them. They are very ſtraight paths, and there are no laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths in which they involve you. Bring but honeſty enough, and there needs not much wit, and no cunning at all to follow theſe courſes. Do but conſider this well, and you will think it a great happineſs to follow Jeſus. For the obtaining of whoſe love and favour, of his reſt and peace, you need not uſe any baſe Arts, nor practiſe deceitful tricks, nor work treaſons, nor be at the charge to calumniate your neighbours, nor take the pains to lye and couzen, to cog and flatter, to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour the luſts of men, to contradict your reaſon, and wound your conſcience. It will coſt you neither bad nights, nor unquiet ſleep, nor vexatious dayes, nor careful thoughts; it will ſtand you neither in the loſs of honour, nor the loſs of life and happineſs; but in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and eaſie wayes, in pleaſant and ſafe courſes you may provide for the immortality of them both. I cannot but call them pleaſant, becauſe I am aſſured that when you are once uſed to the Rode, you will find the moſt rugged wayes to be more delightful, and in all regards more eaſie to the Pilgrims feet, than any of thoſe are, which lead unto the oppoſite Countries. The greateſt
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:101895:128"/>difficulty will be at the firſt entrance, as indeed it uſes to be in the beginning of all other labours; but when you and the wayes are once acquainted, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent you will not be perſwaded to turn into any other paths, though you were infallibly aſſured they would lead you to the Imperial Throne, and make you Lord of the world. There is never a ſtep of your Journey (as it were eaſy for me to demonſtrate) but it will have ſomething of ſweetneſs in it; your ſoul will cloſe with every thing that you have to do, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than your ſtomach imbraces the meat it loves; you ſhall not ſtay for all your peace till you come to <hi>Jeſus</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but he will make you know that <hi>all his wayes are pleaſantneſs, and all his paths are peace.</hi>

                           <p>When <hi>Hercules</hi> was yet but a little Youth educated at <hi>Thebes, Mercury</hi> was one day ſent to him from Heaven, that he might make a trial of his inclinations, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him in all vertuous and noble undertakings. For this end he carried him in unknown ways to the top of an high Mountain, which it would be too long to give you a deſcription of in my Authors words. Thus much it is neceſſary for you to know, that it ſeemed but one to thoſe who ſtood at the foot of it, having but one root and one body as far as their eyes could reach; but indeed was parted into two Hills before it came to its utmoſt height, which were alſo very widely diſtant the one from the other. The one of theſe was called the <hi>Royal Tower,</hi> or the <hi>Temple of King Jupiter:</hi> The other had the name of the <hi>Tyrannical Fort,</hi> the ſeat in old time of the proud <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> whom <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſtruck down with Thunder from Heaven. To theſe two there was a ſeveral acceſs; and the way to that where Royalty dwelt was very ſafe, wide and plain, ſo that a man might aſcend even in a Chariot to that lofty place, without any danger or fear of falling: But to the other the way was narrow, crooked, and ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that a man muſt creep upon his hands and feet who intended to come thither. Nay, ſo full of hazard it was, that many who adventured to go in it, had been ſeen to precipitate themſelves, and were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly loſt in a great Lake which was at the bottom of it. To thoſe who beheld them afar off, they ſeemed, as I ſaid before, to be but One; but the <hi>Royal Hill</hi> was far more eminent, lifting its head above the Region of the Air, and enjoying the benefit of the pure Sky; and the other was more depreſſed, having a cap of Clouds continually upon its head ſo thick and foggy, that they made it an obſcure
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:101895:129"/>and diſmal place. Now <hi>Hercules</hi> being brought thither, and having the nature of this Mountain thus ſhown to him, was already touched with ſo much ambition as to deſire to be admitted into the interiours of them both. Which he had no ſooner ſignified, than it was by <hi>Mercury</hi> granted, who ſaid, Follow me, and thou ſhalt behold moſt clearly the vaſt diſparity of theſe two, which is altogether hid from the eyes of Fools. And preſently he diſcovered to him upon the top of the former, a Woman ſitting on a very ſplendid Throne: who was exceeding beautiful, and of goodly proportions; cloathed in white rayment, and having a Scepter in her hand neither of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver nor Gold; but of a more pure and ſhining nature, like to that which <hi>Juno</hi> weilds. Her countenance was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of a mixture of ſmiles and gravity; ſo that all good men looked confidently upon her, and the evil were no more able to behold her, than they who have weak eyes can indure to turn them to the Sun. She ſeemed more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over to be ſo fixed, and alwayes like her ſelf, that her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and eyes did not betray ſo much as an inclination to change her ſerious ſweetneſs. And indeed it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable to ſee the quiet, peaceableneſs and conſtant temper of that place, to behold the plenty of fair fruit, which it every where yielded, and to obſerve how all the creatures of every kind which lived there, did skip and dance round about it, as if they were tickled with an inward pleaſure. Of Gold and Silver, and other Metals, there lay great heaps before her; and yet ſhe ſeemed to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with none of them, but only in the fruits and in the ſeveral creatures which ſhe beheld in ſuch contentment ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding her. When <hi>Hercules</hi> therefore had fixed his eyes a while upon her, he bluſhed exceedingly, and fell down in a humble veneration of her, no otherwiſe than as a dutiful Child would do before a brave and generous Mother. And
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:101895:130"/>having at laſt demanded of <hi>Mercury</hi> the name and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this perſon, he told him, that it was the bleſſed and heavenly Queen, <hi>BASILEA,</hi> the Daughter of King <hi>Jupiter,</hi> whom he ſaw attended with many fair La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that were eaſie to be diſcovered, and of no leſs Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity than the Queen her ſelf. It is true, replyed the young man, I behold, to my no ſmall ſatisfaction, ſeveral divine perſons waiting upon that Heaven-born <hi>Baſilea;</hi> but may I be ſo happy as to know their Names alſo? She, ſaid <hi>Mercury,</hi> on the Queens right hand, who looks upon us with a ſtern mild countenance, is <hi>Juſtice</hi> a perſon of great account, and very beautiful? Hard by her there ſtands <hi>Uprightneſs,</hi> or <hi>Integrity;</hi> who is ſo like the former, that you can ſcarce know them aſunder, and is not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to her in fairneſs. As for her whom thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeſt on the other hand, a woman very ſpecious and goodly, bravely cloathed, and ſmiling on us, her name is <hi>Peace.</hi> She that ſtands juſt before the Queen, and even touches her Scepter, an ancient gray-headed Matron, ſtrong, and as thou eaſily ſeeſt, very magnanimous, She is called <hi>Law,</hi> or as others ſometimes name her, <hi>Right Reaſon:</hi> A perſon who is of her Privy Council, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtirs from her, without whom it is a crime to do, or ſo much as to think any thing.</p>
                           <p>It would be too tedious to relate how the Youth was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed with this ſight, and how he endeavoured to print his mind with it, ſo that he might never forget it. But in ſhort, he gazed ſo long upon <hi>Baſilea,</hi> and her Royal Attendants, that <hi>Mercury</hi> was fain to call to him, and bid him not to ſpend his whole time in that contemplation, but to deſcend a little with him, and look a while upon the other place alſo, which was not unworthy of his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And indeed he thought with himſelf that it might
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:101895:130"/>be uſeful to him as well as this, and therefore he willingly conſenting to go whither he would carry him, <hi>Mercury</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly brought him to a certain path which led to the <hi>Tyrannical Tower.</hi> There they ſaw a great number who waited for an opportunity to croud into it (the way, as I told you, being very narrow) and many that were contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yea killing one the other to force their paſſage. The Father there was murdering his children, the children dragged their Parents to execution, and one Brother em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued his hands in anothers blood: <hi>Deſiring nothing elſe but the greateſt evil, and calling that the higheſt Happineſs, which is only Power and Folly married together.</hi> And firſt of all he bade him take notice of the entrance to that place, how dangerous it was, how full of precipices, and how it was ſo undermined in ſeveral paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, that the earth was ready to fall under thoſe who trod upon it. All the way likewiſe he ſhowed him was beſmear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with blood; and paved with skulls and dead mens bones, ſo that he ſaw it was not fit to let him ſet his foot in it, but he carried him in a fairer tract to an advantagious place, where he might take a juſt proſpect of that part of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whereon <hi>Tyranny</hi> had ſeated her ſelf. To a great height ſhe was raiſed, though (as I noted before) ſhe could not be elevated to ſuch a pitch, as to free her ſelf from the vapours and miſts which infect theſe lower Regions. But he could clearly diſcern that ſhe ſtudied be to like the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable <hi>Baſilea,</hi> and therefore feigned and counterfeited as much as ſhe could the face, the geſtures, the very Air of that Queen of Beauties. Nay, her Throne ſeemed to be far higher and better than the others, having many fair ſculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon it, and being adorned with Gold, Ivory, Ebony, and ſuch like varieties as Riches furniſhed her withall: But yet the foot of the Throne was not fixed, nor could all the wealth ſhe was Miſtreſs of procure, that it might ſtand
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:101895:131"/>faſt without any ſhaking or tottering at all. Nor was there any thing orderly and handſomely diſpoſed about her; but every thing was faſhioned to comport with the Ends of Glory, Pride and Luxury, which in truth reigned over her, as ſhe over others. Many Scepters there were in her hand, and more then one Diadem upon her head; but they could not make her beautiful, becauſe the more ſhe ſtudied to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the others manners the more deformed and ugly ſhe appeared. When ſhe thought to come forth with her friendly ſmiles, the eyes of thoſe that lookt upon her were entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with nothing but a baſe and filthy kind of crafty grin. In ſtead alſo of the Gravity which ſhe affected, a ſtrange fierceneſs and terrour diſcovered it ſelf in her looks. Nay, that ſhe might ſeem magnanimous ſhe would not often caſt her eyes on thoſe who approached her, but turn them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way with a lofty diſdain; whereby ſhe became the object of all mens hatred, as they were of her ſcorn. Care ſhe took of no body but her ſelf; nor could ſhe by all her care make her ſelf to ſit in quiet; but often ſtared round about her, and ſtarted up, or leaped out of her Throne, as if ſhe ſate uneaſily, or apprehended ſome approaching dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Gold ſhe ſometimes filthily kept in her very boſome; ſometimes in a fright threw it abroad among the people; and then again ſnatched it out of their hands and was ſo greedy of it, that ſhe pillaged every body that had but the leaſt grain of it about them. And not to name her gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he ſayes were of divers colours, ſhe her ſelf uſed to be of as many colours as they. Being ſometimes in Fears, ſometimes in Anger; ſometimes troubled with a fit of Jealouſie, and ſometimes over confident of her ſelf and others. Now being very humble and ſervile; and preſently after proud and inſolent; at this moment laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very loudly; and in the next as bitterly bewailing ſome misfortune or other. They that were about her alſo were
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:101895:131"/>as different from the Attendants before named, as ſhe her ſelf was from the Queen. Their names were, <hi>Cruelty, Contumely, Iniquity,</hi> and <hi>Sedition,</hi> who all ſerved only to corrupt her and bring her to deſtruction. And I muſt not forget to relate that inſtead of Friendſhip, of which all are in ſo great need, ſhe was daily attended by a ſervile and illiberal fellow called <hi>Flattery,</hi> who was no leſs trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous to her then the reſt, and indeed above all others ſought her ruine. He was ever ſtudying to form pleaſing propoſitions; and if they were but grateful to her it was ſufficient; for he never took any care about the good or hurt that was in them. It was a wonder to obſerve the Arts whereby he inſinuated himſelf into her mind: what a ſtrict intelligence he kept with her paſſions: and how he ſeized on all the avenues and lockt up all the paſſages of her ſoul when he was once poſſeſſed of it, that none could be admitted to ſuch a confidence as himſelf. He was ever whiſpering ſome of his lewd Maxims into her ear, and breathing ſome vitious Counſel or other into her heart: But he did it ſo ſoftly that they could then hear nothing that he ſaid, and therefore he that relates the ſtory hath reported nothing of it. But I have been informed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who hath approached very near to the ſecrets of that Villany, that he was wont to advance ſuch doctrines as theſe. That a Prince ought not to ſuffer himſelf to be bound with the fetters of Laws. That it was below him to be ſubject to the Fancies and Viſions of ancient Legiſlators. That every thing was Juſt which was his Will. And that it was a weak and feeble thing to ſeek to be beloved. A great ſpirit ought rather to indeavour to make himſelf feared: and at the moſt he ſhould aim only at his, that he might not be hated. Nay I have heard that he ſhould ſay (and I give you the very words of the perſon from whom I had it) That Honeſty was the Vertue of a Merchant and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:101895:132"/>not of a Soveraign. That in Heaven they put the very Oaths of Princes in the ſame ſcales with thoſe of Lovers. That Jupiter commands them to be thrown into the wind as trivial things and of no value. For this he alledged ſome Poet, for they were all the Divines which he conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and were ſrequently alſo abuſed by him. And ſo in a way of Fooling and telling of Tales he perſwaded her that ſhe need not keep her word, nor tye her ſelf to follow any thing elſe but her own deſires. It would be too long to tell you how ingenious this perſon was in inventing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: and how he ſtudied to indear himſelf by ſhameful ſervices. And indeed moſt of thoſe things were then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed and had a curtain drawn before them, only thus much he overheard: That he jeared at Vertue and laught at Piety as a ſneaking quality, and the effect of a creeping, weak and ſuperſtitious mind. And that he commended a voluptuous life out of all meaſure, calling them Fools whoſe nice and delicate conſciences, made them rude and cruel to their fleſh.</p>
                           <p>Now when <hi>Hercules</hi> had carefully view'd this Golden Creature with all her Servants, as well as he had done the other, <hi>Mercury,</hi> according to his Commiſſion demanded of him, that he ſhould tell him truly which of theſe did pleaſe him beſt and was held by him in greateſt admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To which he preſently replyed, In good ſadneſs, the former ſeemed to me ſo glorious, that I not only loved and admired her, but took her for a Goddeſs and thought her worthy of Worſhip and Imitation: But this is ſo odious and abominable in my opinion, that I would gladly have the liberty to throw her headlong from this high rock and break her neck. You know how much I loath the brutiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her life (continued he, as ſome Authours relate) and how I deſpiſe all her baſe and ſordid pleaſures. For
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:101895:132"/>when Pleaſure her ſelf appeared to me in a Viſion and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented me with all her beauties; you may well remember how I ſcorned her courtſhip, and reſolved to embrace la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Vertue as the Miſtreſs of greater pleaſures. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it be not lawful for me to lay Violent hands on that Fury, yet let the heavens ſpurn her into that condition, which ſhe kicks others down into; and let not proſperous Impiety be alwayes held as good as Vertue. This heat of his, <hi>Mercury</hi> repreſſed and bad him have Patience in as great eſteem as any of the Vertues he had beheld; but his Judgement which he had given in favour of <hi>Baſilea</hi> he praiſed and commended as it did deſerve, and having told it unto <hi>Jupiter,</hi> That was the thing, they ſay, which gained him the Empire of the World, and moved the Heavens to commit all Mankind to his care and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>

               <p>I doubt I have tired you with this long Story, but I ſhall not trouble you much further. Nor ſhall I ſtudy to ſhow you how fitly may hence be repreſented the Happineſs of all other men in their ſeveral condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions who take the wayes of Piety, and the Miſery of all the reſt who tread in any other path; for you are of capacity to do this ſervice for your ſelf. All that I ſhall ſay is only this, That to the men of this world they ſeem the very ſame as the Mountain in the ſtory did: And becauſe all things here fall alike to all, they think it is all one what courſe a man holds if it be but conformable to his own appetite. But you may look upon me if you pleaſe as ſtanding in the place and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a <hi>Mercury</hi> to you, to ſhow you the Holy Hill of God, and the beauteous City which is built upon it, and the Glorious Monarch which inhabits it, together with the way which leads thither, and the vaſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:101895:133"/>which it hath over that <hi>Babel</hi> which men have built in their own fancies, and which would fain reach up to Heaven, but tumbles down together with them into endleſs ruine. And truly I cannot but fancy you to be another couragious <hi>Hercules,</hi> who ſeeing how high the aſcent to that City is, and over what difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties you are to climb, yet are not at all diſmaid, but reſolved to march in the way thither, though all the Silver and Gold, all the Jollity and pleaſure of the World ſhould lye in the way on the other ſide. The Heavens no doubt applaud your choice and they bid me tell you it ſhall be well rewarded; nay, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhown you that you muſt needs be more happy in that courſe then in any elſe that can be invented. For though the Hill be high and ſteep which you are to mount, yet the way is plain and eaſie, pleaſures guard it round about, and a glorious place it brings you unto at the laſt. As you will totally eſcape thoſe wayes wherein, according to the ſtory now told, there are nothing but intricacy and uncertainty, miſts and darkneſs, trouble and ſorrow, anxiety and diſquiet, and in a word a great deal of pains to make a man doubly miſerable: So you will be conducted in plain, natural, and unperplexed paths, in paths of pleaſure and peace, of confidence and aſſurance, of light and ſerenity, of ſet ledneſs and ſtedineſs of mind, which will not let you be a ſtranger to an abundant happineſs. I know the pretended ſatisfactions in the other way may make a greater ſhow, and appear more ſplendid, accompanied with more pomp and noiſe: but if you be in love with ſtill and ſilent joyes, with grave de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and ſerious pleaſures, they are only to be found in this way which I have pointed you unto. You ſhall never tremble in the midſt of theſe enjoyments, nor
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:101895:133"/>ſhall you be troubled with fear leſt you ſhould loſe your happineſs. There are no mock-ſmiles here, when the heart is wrung within: but the eaſe of the mind makes the countenance ſmooth, and the joy of the heart caſts a ſplendor into the eyes and a ſweetneſs into the face. You ſhall never be flattered and cheated here with the deluſions of momentary plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: but every taſt you have of joy ſhall be an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of an everlaſting felicity. Nay, you ſhall give a great joy to others alſo, and pleaſe them as well as your ſelf. You ſhall make all that are about you to rejoyce, and their contentment will be an addition to your own. The ſatisfaction of making others happy and ſeeing them full of comfort by your means; will not let you doubt of your own happineſs, nor want that peace which you give to them. And then after all this, you ſhall find your ſelf at laſt, though not made Maſter of all this World; yet brought to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> the City of the great King, of the Lord of all; there to reign with him in eternal Glory.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the Pilgrim's requeſt, the Guide enters into a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſcription of the Pleaſures of the <hi>Way</hi> to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> and anſwers ſome ſcruples of his about it. The difficulty of the beginning of his journey. Of taking up the Croſs that might lye in his way; and ſuch like things.</head>
               <p>I Will not undertake to expreſs to you the ſilent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration wherewith the <hi>Pilgrim</hi> entertained this diſcourſe. He lookt upon him with no leſs wonder
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:101895:134"/>then if he had thought him an Envoyé from Heaven, and taken him to be diſpatched with a meſſage imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from God to tranſport him thither. He was almoſt loſt in a new paſſion; and if it had not been for fear that the good man would here make an end if he did not intreat him to continue his diſcourſe, he had abandoned himſelf to thoſe pleaſant imaginations which the telling of that ſtory had raiſed in his mind. But recovering himſelf from their inticements, he got leave of them to ſpeak to his Guide to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Ah Sir, what a favour have you done me? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what a delightful train of thoughts have you lead me? It is impoſſible to relate the pleaſure you have now given me. I do not think that your ſelf can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the like upon me by any other means, but only by making this Story a little longer. You do it a great deal of wrong I aſſure you, in calling it tedious; for if it were lawful to gratifie my ſelf in the way that I fancy moſt, I ſhould wiſh that it might laſt to the end of my life. You are a true <hi>Mercury</hi> indeed, the Orator of the Great King, the interpreter of God. You are ſent to do me a double kindneſs; firſt to be my Guide, and then to raviſh me into the way you ſhow me, by your eloquence. May not the caeleſtial natures be preſumed to have ſome Patience, as well as ſo much Charity? Shall I offend you if I deſire a more particular deſcription of the eaſe and pleaſure which you promiſe me in my way? Or cannot you ſtay ſo long as to pull a little ſcruple out of my mind, and tell me how this way can be ſo broad as your Story ſaith, ſince I have learnt of one more Sacred that it is ſtrait and narrow? I know I am indebted to you but too much for the favours you have already done me; And except it be in my hearty wiſhes I can never be ſo
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:101895:134"/>bountiful as you have been. But yet give me leave to ſay that this exceſſive freeneſs, is a temptation to run further into your debt. If you had been more reſerved at the firſt, you had made me more modeſt; but now that you have been ſo prodigal of your counſel, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me if I think that I have nothing elſe to accuſe of my confidence. If you would not have had me become ſuch a Beggar, you ſhould not have been ſo generous: you ſhould either have withheld your hand ſooner, or not be offended that I implore a freſh taſt of your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality. Go on good Sir to add to my obligations: for though they are ſo great already that you force me to be ungrateful by leaving me no power, not ſo much as that of words, to thank you; yet let me ſee you take ſuch a pleaſure in doing of good that you think your ſelf ſufficiently paid for what you have done, by gaining mens will to a hearty deſire of receiving more.</p>
               <p>I am no Maſter of eloquence, ſaid the Guide, but you are beholden as I told you to a Stranger for that pleaſant deſcription. It is enough for me if I can point at the way to Heaven, and give you ſome plain and familiar directions how to find it. But you muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade your ſelf to learn and follow thoſe inſtructions, and not expect the aſſiſtance of any Rhetorick of mine to woo your heart to intertain them. And truly if I may judge by what you juſt now ſaid, you have power enough in your own hands to charm your affections, and inſinuate what I teach you into their favour. You may be indebted to your ſelf more then to me; and owe your happineſs rather to your own perſwaſion, then any Oratory that I can imploy. But yet if you can be content with ſuch dry narrations as I am able to make,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:101895:135"/>you cannot demand any thing with more eaſe, then I ſhall yield to the ſatisfaction of your deſires. It will be no trouble to me I aſſure you to prolong my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on this delightful theme, and I ſhall more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie my ſelf thereby then oblige you; though I muſt needs ſay that I think there is not ſo much need of it as you may imagine. You may take this upon my credit, that you will better experiment the pleaſure of your way as you go along, then it is poſſible to perceive it by the moſt accurate deſcription which can be made of it by the pen or tongue of man. You have often no doubt taſted the ſweetneſs of honey: but ſuppoſe you had only ſeen the golden colour of it with your eyes, or only heard a graceful ſpeaker make an Oration in its praiſe; would either of theſe have made you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, ſo well as one little lick with your tongue is able to do? The caſe is not at all different here, and therefore begin to proſecute your reſolution preſently of travelling to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> go to the wayes themſelves to learn their pleaſantneſs; for they will teach you more in an inſtant, then I can do by many of my long diſcourſes. But yet that you may not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine I put you off, and refer you thither only to ſpare my pains, I ſhall at leaſt give you ſome ſatisfaction in the truth of what I ſay and convince your reaſon that you muſt needs find the wayes you are to paſs very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful notwithſtanding all thoſe difficulties which you may meet withall.</p>
               <p>All the actions of nature you will grant to be very pleaſant, for they flow from us with eaſe and facility; and they alſo tickle us as they paſs along becauſe they run ſmoothly and do not grate upon us. Now there is nothing plainer then that the wayes of <hi>Temperance,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:101895:135"/>Charity, Truſt in God</hi> and ſuch like wherein you are to walk are moſt conformable to the right frame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of your ſoul. You will move conſonantly to your own principles which God hath naturally indued you withall: you will but follow the inclination of rational nature and that in its higheſt improvement, which muſt needs yield you the higheſt delight and ſatisfaction. Will you but be pleaſed for the proof of this to aſk your ſoul a few Queſtions? I am confident if it go about to reſolve them, it will give it ſelf a ſenſe of the goodneſs of the paths of Piety; and without any other evidence then they carry in themſelves, it will pronounce that they are far eaſier and ſo infinitely more ſweet then any that oppoſe them. I appeal to you and to all the world whether it be not a buſineſs of quicker diſpatch to forgive an injury, then to take revenge for it? whether he doth not more ſeek his own eaſe and repoſe who ſtudyes to forget the malice of men towards him; then he that ſuffers the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it to ferment and boil perpetually in his mind? Is it not a buſineſs of leſs difficulty to be peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and quiet, then to be ever contending, quarrelling and falling out with our neighbours? And what toil is there in ſitting ſtill and not ſo much as lifting up our hands? and on the other ſide, what labour in fighting, and beating, and wounding one another? Is it not far more eaſie to hold ones peace, then to rail and revile as much as we pleaſe? Which puts us to more pains to ſay nothing but well of others, or to be alwayes finding fault, and ſtill ſpeaking evil of them? Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſeems to me to be far leſs troubleſome then anger and rage. Charity is more eaſie and delightſome, then covetouſneſs and ſcraping up of wealth. To drink little is ſooner and eaſier done, then to drink
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:101895:136"/>and ſwill as if we were in a perpetual Feaver. And I cannot ſee what ſhould hinder you from confeſſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly that it is a thing of far more eaſe and facility to live by Faith in God, to depend on his providence in honeſt wayes, and to caſt our burden upon him; than to be alwayes careful and ſollicitous, to be ever vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves with worldly thoughts, and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing ſhifts and naughty Arts how to get more than we need. Is it any burden to praiſe God for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings he ſends us? Or, Is it not more natural than to praiſe and commend our ſelves to which all men ſeem ſo forward? And how can it be ſo toilſome to pray to him for what we want, as it is to ſpend our time in a laborious diligence, without a ſerious and hearty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of him? To be humble and modeſt is far more agreeable than to bear it high, and lift up our ſelves above others. It is nothing ſo hard to obey Governours, as to be turbulent, and fall into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt them. Yea to ſuffer wrongs breeds us leſs moleſtation than to do them. To be patient creates us not half ſo much trouble, as it doth to vex, and fret, and ſume within our ſelves. To rejoyce in God is a thing that more gratifies, than all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſenſe. And even to mourn for our ſins doth give us more ſatisfaction, than to mourn and grieve for worldly loſſes.</p>
               <p>It would be a very eaſie matter, I beleeve you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to make a long diſcourſe on this argment: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to ſhew that beſides the eaſe and the pleaſure that there is in doing theſe things, they leave alſo a certain joy and contentment when they are done. They that hold the courſe into which you are entring, do feel that every ſtep they take leaves a certain print behind
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:101895:136"/>it, which it is an infinite delight to reflect upon. They enjoy a repoſe and ſecurity in their conſciences, which is not to be uttered: and remain in great tranquillity. all their lives. There is no body that can rob them of their pleaſures; neither can any man intercept them, and hinder them from coming into their ſouls: nor will they themſelves be ever weary of them, or deſire to make an exchange of them for ſome other content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There is no diſguſt in thoſe holy delights. They breed no diſlike by their frequent enjoyment. They depend not as others do on infinite circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whereof the want of any one makes them either odious or unprofitable: but they have a conſtant cauſe, and depend but upon one thing, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes preſent, and inſeparable from all good ſouls. They live without fear in their poſſeſſions; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtruſt in their wants. They do not bluſh in the company of others; nor do they tremble when they are alone. They are not bitten with remorſe, nor covered with ſhame for what is paſt; and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition is not troubled with any diſquiet; and they have nothing but fair and goodly hopes for the time to come. In fine, they are the portion of God in the world, they are his treaſure; they are his delight and his joy: and whenſoever he makes them know ſo much, there is not an higher pleaſure that the heart of man is capable to poſſeſs. To make joy in Heaven, to give delight to the King of the world, O what a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhment is it? What glorious hopes doth the thought of it inſpire us withall? It would make any man cry out, I will be good; I vow that I will be good, though the whole world ſhould oppoſe me in it. Your very fleſh will conſent to be one of the ſubjects of Jeſus, if you do but let it know the happineſs that he will
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:101895:137"/>bring unto it. It will become a Votary to him, when you underſtand how much the better it ſhall fare for that repoſe of your mind, and the conſtant pleaſure of a regular life. Your very ſtomach cannot but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his meaſures, and ſubmit it ſelf to his Laws, who layes no burden upon it, but rather eaſes it of all its loads. It will complain of your unkindneſs if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it the favour of being abſolutely governed by his will. There is never a drop of blood in your body, but had rather be ſpilt in his ſervice, than that you ſhould refuſe his bleſſed life, which leads to ſuch endleſs felicity to the whole man. Conſult every thing about you: Take advice of every thing that belongs to you: and it will confeſs that there is no ſuch Maſter of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the whole world as the <hi>Holy Jeſus;</hi> that it is the greateſt Epicuriſm to be one of his followers; and that if a man ſhould ſtudy till the worlds end, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver caſt himſelf into ſuch an extaſie of joy, as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and belief of what he hath promiſed, and an heart full of love to him proportionable to that belief, will put him into. And therefore it is a wonder that the Voluptuaries of the world go to any other School than his, to learn the Art of making much of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Here is true pleaſure; here is the very ſpring of all contentment. It is the very inſcription upon the door or entrance of Chriſts School, that <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, bleſſed are the pure in heart, bleſſed are the meek, bleſſed are the peaceable, bleſſed are the merciful, yea bleſſed are they that mourn, and that ſuffer for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſake.</hi> Nor are theſe vain braggs, and empty boaſts; like the Papers which Empericks ſet upon poſts pretending to the cure of all diſeaſes. But if any man will try, he ſhall find all this to be the very truth; he ſhall preach this doctrine himſelf to the world; he
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:101895:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſhall avow it confidently to all that he meets, that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> only brings true reſt to their ſouls and bodies. Nor is the tryal of ſuch difficulty that you or my man elſe ſhould refuſe it. When you have left my company, and are retired to your ſelf, do but fix your mind, as long as you are wont to do on leſſer buſineſſes, upon theſe truths; that Jeſus is exalted at the right hand of God, that he hath received a Kingdom and Glory from the Father, that he hath power to raiſe up you to ſit with him in his Throne, that he will infallibly take you up to himſelf, that you may be there where he is, and behold the Glory which God hath given him; and then tell me if ever you felt any thing touch your heart with ſuch a pleaſure as the bare contemplation of thoſe divine enjoyments. The very fancy of them is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Such a dream, if a man was in it, he would not loſe for all that he ſees here. He would be troubled to be awaked, and ſhut his eyes again, wiſhing that it may know no end. And therefore the aſſurance of theſe things to be a certain truth which the Holy Ghoſt coming down from Jeſus hath given to us, muſt needs give us a far greater ſatisfaction. A ſatisfaction as much beyond that of fancy; as a ſenſible enjoyment is beyond a dream. And what the contentment will be if we ſuffer theſe truths to go down to our hearts, to raviſh our wills, to breathe into us the Love of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and to bring all thoſe <hi>Bleſſed Vertues</hi> into our eſteem and affection, I have not power enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. But as you love your ſoul, do not deny it your beſt endeavour, that before this day be at an end, you may have a real feeling of it.</p>
               <p>And now it may be fit for your fuller conviction in this particular, to bid you turn your eyes to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:101895:138"/>of other men who are ingaged in a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary courſe: and you will ſoon ſee that to be a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant path wherein I conduct you, by the miſery and confuſion which you will diſcern in their lives. It will not be long before you be ſatisfied, that they are not in a ſtate of Nature. They will preſently diſcover to you, that they are not as they ſhould be: Nay, that they would be ſomething elſe, than what they are, and that long uſe and cuſtom hath rendred contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions familiar to them. There is not one of them but he loves that which he hates, and purſues that which he flyes, and praiſes that which he cannot but alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend. There are ſtrange ſeditions and claſhings in their deſires, and they are toſſed about with I know not how many contrary winds. They all deſire to be rich, and yet this very deſire will not let them be ſo. They fear nothing more than need, and yet they are ever in great want, and cannot be filled. For they alwayes think that which they have to be leſs than that which they have not; and they take that which is preſent to be ſo little, that it is not worth their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in compare of what they expect in time to come. And is there is any greater conſiſtency in their deſires of pleaſure? Alas! they purſue mirth, but they ever pull upon their heads a great deal of ſorrow. They would have nothing at all but ſweetneſs; and the more greedy they are of it, the greater is their bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. When they think to heighten their delights; they quite deſtroy them, and take them away. When they would leave no place empty, they are ſo full that they cannot feel them. Do you not ſee all this verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in drunken fools? Where is their pleaſure after their Underſtanding is once blaſted with the fumes of Wine? A Spunge is as good a Judge as they of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:101895:138"/>which, without any difference, ſucks in the beſt and the worſt of liquors. And as for Death, Which of them is there that doth not fear it, and yet they take no care at all to live? They dread diſeaſes, and yet they will not abſtain from noxious and unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome things. When any trouble falls upon them, then they wiſh they were out of the world, and bleſs thoſe that are dead; and yet when death comes, though they are never ſo ill, they wiſh it would ſtay a little longer. They hate many times to live, and yet they are afraid to dye. They think them happy who are in the other world, but yet they are loath to come among them. They cry out of the evils which they ſuffer, and yet they would fain ſpin out the moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable life to the greateſt length. But there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing that is ſtranger than this. For you have often heard them complain (I believe) of the great ſcarcity of time, and yet which of them is there that is not ſo prodigal of it, as if he had half a Age to ſpare? They ſay that it runs away very ſwiftly from us, and yet they ſpur on their hours, and would have them flye away faſter than they do, as if they had too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them. There are but a few ſeaſons, they ſay, in time, and yet they let thoſe opportunities grow old in their hands, and ſuffer them to be bald before they mind to apprehend them. And did you ever mark how they deal one with another? Each man ſuſpects his fellow, becauſe he deſerves to be ſuſpected himſelf. Every one is afraid to be deceived, and labours all he can to deceive. He hath a great mind to be revenged, and yet he would not have Juſtice it ſelf take any ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of him. He hates Tyranny, and yet he would fain be the Tyrant. He would have all men ſubject to thoſe Laws, which he hath no mind to obſerve. He
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:101895:139"/>accuſes many things as baſe, but will not ſtick to do them. And on the contrary, he holds good fortune in great eſtimation, but cares not a ruſh for vertue, which yet he acknowledges deſerves only to be fortunate.<note place="margin">Max.

                  </note> Philoſophers themſelves have been aſhamed to ſee how they all behave themſelves in every condition like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant fools. They abhor War, but cannot tell how to live in Peace. They are miſerably dejected if they be made ſlaves, but are ſo inſolent in liberty, that they draw ſervitude upon them. They deſire children, and when they have them take no care about them. They would leave them eſtates, but no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to uſe them well, and to preſerve them. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have their family alway flouriſh; but breed them ſo, as if they meant it ſhould dye with the next Generation. Nay, God himſelf is not better uſed by them. For they pray to him, as if he was able to do them good, and yet they affront him, as if it was not in his power to do them hurt. At other times they fear him, as if he could ſeverely puniſh, and yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear themſelves, as if he had no Being but only when they pleaſed. But that I may not run into infinite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, let us once for all take a view of thoſe who would attain to great honours, and ſee by what low, mean and ſervile practices they labour to aſcend unto them. There is nothing which their heart abhors more than ſubjection to others, and yet they are forced to the baſeſt proſtrations. They ſtoop to the very feet of thoſe, upon whoſe heads they would tread. They kiſs thoſe hands, which they wiſh a thouſand times were cut off, if they oppoſe their deſigns. Their very idleneſs is in action day and night. The comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ceremonies they beſtow upon others, are a buſineſs of greater trouble, than the ruling of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:101895:139"/>and diſpoſing of Kingdoms. It may ſeem ſtrange, but there is nothing truer, That if a man would climb to the higheſt place in the world, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary he ſhould become lame, and breath ſhort, and take ſuch little ſteps, as if a long Ague had but juſt left him to the uſe of his leggs; and in one word, ſeem al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unfit for the buſineſs he deſigns. You know what a glory it is to be the ſuppoſed Head of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome. And yet they that are well acquainted with the wayes to that office, tell us in plain terms, that he muſt keep his Bed, and uſe all the Arts which Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick can aſſiſt him withall, not to be well, but to be ill; who hopes to attain that dignity. He muſt put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into a feavouriſh heat; he muſt beg the help of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions and catarrhs; he muſt procure a pale look, and a meagre aſpect; he muſt cough as if he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for his grave; or elſe he muſt loſe that place which will not come at eaſier rates. And now what think you? Are not theſe fine wayes to Glory? Have not they a great mind to trouble themſelves, that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe trouble at ſo great a price? For the riſing to high places (as a wiſe man of our own obſerves) is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry laborious, and by pains men come to greater pains: Nay, it is ſometimes very baſe, and by indignities men come to dignities. Perhaps this ambitious fool doth flatter continually thoſe whom he hates: He applauds and praiſes thoſe whom he deſpiſes: He admires all that is ill done: He approves of all that a wicked and debauched appetite deſires: He ſpeaks againſt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and ſmiles on him whom he could bite and faſten his teeth upon with all his heart. He diſſembles all his reſentments; and though he love revenge as well as his life, yet he is put to the pains of ſtifling all thoſe paſſions which are its ſervants. There is a fire
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:101895:140"/>in his bones, and he dare not give it the leaſt vent, that others may feel it as well as himſelf. He ſwallows all the affronts which a Porter gives him at a Great mans Gate; and he bribes thoſe with gifts whom he wiſhes dead, that he might enjoy their places. And when he is mounted to the top of his deſires, I beſeech you, on what Pinnacles doth he tread? Which are ſo ſmall, that there is but a little between him and the danger of a fall; and withall ſo ſharp, that they wound the feet which tread upon them. And did you never perceive the delight that ſome men take in laughing at the meanneſs of the extraction of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor? The greateſt honours are not able to cleanſe the blemiſhes of his family. And when he hath done all that he can, bold ſpirits will throw in his face the dirt from whence he is ſprung; and wound him with a remembrance that he is but a New Man.</p>
               <p>But then if one of theſe perſons chance to drop down to the place where he was before, and become the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſcorn, in what a ſad condition is he? When the Play is ended, and the high-heel'd Buskins are pull'd off which raiſed him above others, and the gaudy cloths are torn from his back, and he returns to his firſt form; he becomes a deſpicable creature even to himſelf. So mad a thing it is to judge of a man by the height of honour, to which he is advanced, for it is as if you would take the meaſure of a ſtatue by the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtal on which it ſtands. But beſides all this, the conſcience he hath of his crimes will render him ſtill more miſerable, becauſe it will ever put him in mind that he deſerves his miſery. And as for others, it will likewiſe be a dangerous thing for any man to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the protection or comfort of ſuch a perſon, who
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:101895:140"/>is known to have merited his misfortune. Nay more than this we have heard of ſuch fools, that before they had loſt all their imaginary happineſs, have deprived themſelves of the remainder, out of vexation that it did not continue as great as before. So that great glutton <hi>Apitius</hi> having waſted the beſt part of his eſtate, and finding but two hundred thouſand Crowns remaining; imagined himſelf a Peggar, and drunk a draught of poiſon, becauſe he thought he had not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to maintain his ancient riot. For which he was ſoundly jeered by one of the Sages of thoſe dayes, who ſaid this was the moſt wholeſome draught that ever he made, which put an end to ſuch a diſſolute life.</p>
               <p>Thus, you ſee, theſe vitious men are ſo hated while they are alive, and their memory is ſo perſecuted when they are dead, that I believe you would not ſtand in one of their places. And the more injuries they have done to others, to raiſe themſelves; the more odious they grow, and the more curſes follow them to their graves. So toilſome it is to follow thoſe courſes, that men will not ſuffer them to reſt in peace even in the Sanctuary and common refuge of all the miſerable. They that did not know how to be revenged on their perſons while they were here; are wont to fall upon the Phantaſm which they have left of themſelves in their imagination; and to wreak their ſpleen upon their memory, and ſtab their reputation. They pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their greatneſs for a while, and then they pay very dearly for it. Nay, the time of their pleaſure is ſo ſmall, that they come to it by a far longer time of pains; and when they enjoy it, we ſcarce know how to diſtinguiſh the moments of the one from thoſe of the other; for pains are either mingled with
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:101895:141"/>their pleaſures, or preſently tread upon the heels of them.</p>
               <p>All which, when I conſider, it calls to my mind the Story of the Fool, who paſſing thorow the Forreſt of <hi>Ravenna</hi> as he came from <hi>Rome,</hi> filled a whole Wallet and a Pillow-bear top full of Flyes, Gnats and Hornets, of which that place affords good ſtore, and of no ſmall bigneſs, to bring them home with him. Whither when he was arrived, he ſent to his friends and kinsfolks round about, deſiring to ſee them, that he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them with ſome rarities and curious things which he had brought from <hi>Rome.</hi> Though they knew him to be a Ninny, yet they could not imagine him to be ſuch a Sot as afterward they found him; but fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied that he might have light upon ſomething in his Journey, which might be worth one of theirs to go and ſee it. But when they were met together, and were come into his Chamber, after many complements and great expectations; he had nothing to entertain them withall, but a huge number of thoſe troubleſome creatures which he poured out of his baggs upon them; thinking becauſe of their various colours, that they were precious things, and would yield a fine ſight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his friends. They laught a little at the jeſt at firſt, but they ſoon felt there was no cauſe, when rhey found them about their ears, and flying in their faces, and their eyes in ſuch a manner, that it was no ſmall affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and pain unto them. Juſt ſuch, me-thinks, is the condition of thoſe who live in ſin. They are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed fine things, and ſecret delights by the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which ſend to them, and invite them into their ſociety. Great hopes are given them of new pleaſures, and ſuch rare ſatisfactions as hitherto they have not
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:101895:141"/>met withall. And they are ſuch fools as to believe their imagination, or an idle companion who intices them by fair ſpeeches, though they know very well how often they and others have been deluded by ſuch flatteries. The ſin indeed ſeems pretty at the firſt; it makes them ſome ſport for a while, and you think that they are much pleaſed. But alas! they come a great way for that ſhort mirth, and it is ſo trivial, that it is not worth a flye; and at laſt they are ſtung worſe than by a whole neſt of angry Waſps. Their conſcience is alwayes buzzing ſome evil in their ears; they are perſecuted by it continually, and it follows them with its ſecret murmures; they are tormented as with a ſwarm of Hornets, which will never ceaſe to trouble them as long as they ſtay there, and will not open the door and run away from their ſins.</p>
               <p>And truly by this time it is like you will wonder that they ſhould be content to ſtay in their company. You may very well aſk, what do theſe men mean thus to trouble themſelves, when there is ſuch a viſible way to their peace and quiet? Why do not they break looſe from their ſins, and ſeek their ſatisfaction in ſome other courſe? Had they not better become good, than be at ſo much pains to make themſelves miſerably bad? They cannot but diſcern ſure, that happineſs lyes not in their Rode; and that to enjoy repoſe, they muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the followers of Vertue. And to tell you my mind plainly, I verily think there is a number of them would gladly be her ſervants, if to be made ſo might be wholly the Act of another, and not at all their own. They would think it a bleſſed change to do well, as naturally as they do ill; if this New Nature would but come into them of it ſelf, and not require
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:101895:142"/>their pains to quit the Old. They commend the wayes of Vertue, and think them happy who live tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately and chaſtly; but how to get into them, there is the difficulty. They would gladly find themſelves there the very next moment, but to travel thither is a buſineſs of too much labour. Their own life is a very great trouble to them, but there is ſome trouble alſo in the beginning of a new. Though the way that I ſhew you be ſo pleaſant, that they who are not in it cannot but have a mind to be tranſlated thither; yet the entrance of it is not without ſome difficulties. The ſtings which I told you are in their conſcience, cannot be pulled out without more pain than they are willing to endure. It is a buſineſs of much anguiſh to have the wounds which are made in their natures ſearched and dreſſed, and ſuch applications made, as will draw out all the corruption and filth. They had rather palliate their ſores, than have them raked into, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their being healed. It is a new thing to which we would ingage them, and they apprehend it ſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious alſo, that they think it better to continue as they are, than with a great deal of pains to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them another burden. They that are free from their prepoſſeſſions, find excellent things to be very irkſome when they firſt begin to ſet about them. With what unwillingneſs do children learn their firſt let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, though afterward it prove delightful to be able to read? And how hard do moſt men find the firſt ſtep to any Science, which when they are a little Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of, is infinitely pleaſant? And therefore every one muſt expect to find the gate to be ſtrait which opens to that way wherein you are to travel. There all their old cuſtoms are to be put off. There I know not how many deſires of the fleſh are to be denyed and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:101895:142"/>left behind. There a man muſt be ſtript ſtark naked: He muſt become like a little child, and reduced juſt to nothing in his own eyes, that ſo he may be able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And then alſo there are many ſtrange paths pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves with which he hath had no acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; which is the cauſe that many are affrighted and ſtart back again, rather than they will undergo the troule of preſſing in at ſo ſtrait a paſſage. Though, if it be well conſidered, this is juſt ſuch a folly as if a man in a long Journey perceiving himſelf out of his way, ſhould chuſe ſtill to go on in his errour, rather than go back again, becauſe of the many weariſome ſteps which he muſt be forced to take before he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the right Rode. The further he goes on, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is he out of his way; and conſequently muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to his Journeys end, unleſs it be with greater pains hereafter, than thoſe which he now avoids.</p>
               <p>But not to deceive you, (nor forget a ſhort Anſwer to your other doubt) I muſt alſo let you know, that the way it ſelf, for a few of the firſt miles, is very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row as well as the gate; though afterwards it be as wide and broad as heart can wiſh. That which a man hath put off in reſolution at his entrance into the way, he may find ſtill to hang upon him when he comes to move, and very loath to be quite ſhaken off. His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires which he had contracted, may begin to ſtir and to inlarge themſelves, and complain that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined too much, and reduced into too narrow a room. And ſo it will ſtill ſeem, till by often denyals they grow content, and make room for nobler deſires to ſpring up in him. Then will he think himſelf preſſed and ſtraitned no more, when he finds his ſoul inlarged ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and his appetites carried unſatiably toward
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:101895:143"/>diviner objects. Then he will not ſay he is pent up, when he feel, that the retrenching of his worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires hath ſet his heart at liberty to go whither it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally would, without any reſtraints upon it. He will find that he is at eaſe by being ſtraitned; that he hath got his freedom by being bound up; and that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes as much as he deſires, by denying and pareing of his deſires. It may ſeem indeed a ſtrange way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging our ſouls, by bringing their deſires into a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compaſs: but if you conſider it, there is nothing truer, than that it is much better, and more to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, not to deſire ſome things at all; than to deſire them, and withall to have them as much as we deſire. As for example; we ſee men mad to have their fill of bodily pleaſure. But how doth it fare with them at that ſeaſon? Have not theſe deſires brought a torment to them? No doubt they have much more pleaſure than in abſtaining from that of which they were ſo greedy, than in continuing to enjoy it. Why ſhould it not be thought better than to do that out of vertue which diſordered fulneſs forces them to? Is it not much more eligible to abſtain out of choice, than not to forbear till we are conſtrained? Yes verily; and men would receive a greater ſatisfaction in ſubduing ſuch mad deſires; than it is poſſible to do in the fulfilling of them. It is with theſe carnal people, ſaith one of the old Directors in the way to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as if a man ſhould be ſo dry, that he calls for one cup after another, and though he drink never ſo much, yet cannot quench his thirſt. Certainly ſuch a man cannot be eſteemed happy, becauſe he never wants liquor, but hath ſtill at hand as much as he deſires. No, he is the happy man, who feeling no thirſt is free from this neceſſity of drinking ſo much, and is no way urged to deſire it. For the firſt
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:101895:143"/>is like a man in a burning feavour, and the other like one that injoyes a perfect health. And there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them alſo who verifies this in his own example. For he confeſſes that walking one day with ſome friends through the City of <hi>Milan,</hi> having his head full of an Oration he was to make in the Emperours praiſe, and his heart thirſting after Glory and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he thought it would procure him; and therewith very much contentment: He chanced to caſt his eye upon a Begger who having newly received an Alms, was very blithe and of a pleaſant counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. At which ſpectacle, he fetcht a deep ſigh and ſaid to his company, What a miſchief is this that I ſhould thus drag my own infelicity after me by the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of my deſires, and with ſo much trouble ſeek in vain for that ſatisfaction, which this poor fellow is already arrived at, without ſo much ado? It is better by far to have none of theſe longings, then to take ſuch pains, and perhaps without any fruit, to give them content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If we ſhould have all that our deſires crave, yet it is a ſhorter way to make us happy, To be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. For why do we deſire thoſe pleaſures or honours ſo inordinately? Is it not for the ſatisfaction and joy which we expect to meet with in them? But that we may have ſooner if we can be rid of thoſe deſires. Eſpecially ſince by wanting them, the ſoul hath leave to fill it ſelf with better pleaſures. Such pleaſures as we cannot deſire, but we ſhall have them: and which we cannot have, but we ſhall be filled: and which by filling of us do only more enlarge our ſouls that we may receive a greater fulneſs.</p>
               <p>But there is ſomething ſtill more conſiderable in thoſe words of <hi>Jeſus</hi> which have occaſioned this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:101895:144"/>courſe, for if the propriety of that word be examined whereby he expreſſes the condition of the <hi>Way,</hi> it doth not ſeem to ſignifie ſo much the <hi>narrowneſs</hi> of it, as the <hi>roughneſs, ſtonineſs</hi> and external difficulties wherewith it is incumbred. There are many afflictions and croſſes which may lye in this way; and they deterr ſo much the more delicate ſort, that they ſeem to be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt rub they meet withall, and the ſtrongeſt objection which they make againſt what I have ſaid of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of theſe paths. But let me tell you, that if you imagine it to be far more pleaſant to live after the fleſh, then to take up your Croſs and follow Chriſt in his ſufferings; there is not a groſſer error that can poſſeſs your mind. For <hi>he was made perfect through ſufferings:</hi> And <hi>there was a joy ſet before him which made him dure the Croſs:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.13, 14.</note> And his followers bid us alſo <hi>rejoyce in as much as we are partakers of the ſufferings of Chriſt, that when his Glory ſhall be revealed, we may be glad alſo with exceeding joy.</hi> Nay for the preſent they ſay we ſhall feel our ſelves happy if we be reproached for the name of Chriſt; <hi>for the Spirit of Glory and of God reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon us.</hi> It is a moſt Heroick and Divine temper of mind which expreſſes it ſelf in meek and chearful ſuffering. Then we have opportunity to uſe the moſt glorious vertues. Then thoſe Graces of God ſhine moſt illuſtriouſly which elſe would be obſcured. And cherefore one of theſe great ſouls cryes out and ſayes, <hi>Behold,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 5.11.</note> 
                  <hi>we count them happy which endure.</hi> The braveſt men that ever the world bred, were of the mind that there was no joys comparable to thoſe, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to couragious and patient Vertue. It was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to gratifie them more; you could not lay an higher obligation upon them; then if you preſented them with an occaſion to ſhow their Conſtancy, their
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:101895:144"/>Faith and their Valour. You know who he was that <hi>refuſed to be called the ſon of a Kings daughter; chooſing rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12.25, 26.</note> 
                  <hi>eſteeming the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Chriſt greater riches then the treaſures of</hi> Egypt: <hi>for he had reſpect to the recompence of reward.</hi> Nay I have learnt thus much from Heathens themſelves (for I do not think them unfit for my converſe) that it is neceſſary for good men to enter into agonies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts. They are in need of ſome thing or other to combate withall: and therefore afflictions and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are the <hi>Antagoniſts</hi> of Vertuous ſouls, without whom they could not be lawfully crowned. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity then of Chriſtian Religion I am ſure is ſuch that it will make you welcome Croſſes and ſtretch out your arms to receive them with more reſolution and chearfulneſs then ever Pagans did. You have been a School-boy it is like in your time, and then you could not but hear as well as I the ſtory of <hi>

                  </note> God was pleaſed in meer love and friendſhip to him thus to exerciſe and try his Vertue; propoſing him as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the contentment which both God himſelf and vertuous ſouls do take in their induring the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips which heaven layes upon them. And what do they ſay think you of that great man <hi>Hercules</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of whoſe ſtory you heard before? They tell us that he was beloved of God, and had the higheſt
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:101895:145"/>place in his favour; nay they call him his ſon, and ſay that God committed to him the Government of the World. And yet he was alwayes aſſaulted with ſome Monſter or other, and God would not ſuffer his own child (as one of them ſpeaks) to be nurſed up in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the delicacies of life. No, he fought with Lyons, and Boars, and Serpents, and Tyrants, and Theeves; and he was appointed to travel into ſtrange lands, to croſs dangerous ſeas, and to go through ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible wilderneſſes and deſerts; And all to teſtifie the favour of Heaven to him that would thus imploy him. No doubt his Father could have freed him from ſuch conflicts, but he would not; becauſe (as they render the reaſon) <hi>it is not lawful for him to will any thing but that which is best and moſt excellent.</hi> Or he might have freed himſelf and perhaps ſome men would have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to flee theſe dangers, and rather to quit his place then expoſe his life to ſo many hazzards. But they knew not the pleaſure which he found in his heart, when he remembred that he was thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy by God to be ſingled out to be his Champion; and that Heaven had not an ill opinion of him, nor judged him a weak and effeminate perſon. It was a ſtrange contentment alſo to imagine that all theſe dangers preſented themſelves only that he might overcome them; and he felt that there was not half ſo much pains in fighting, as there was pleaſure in the very hopes of having the Victory. Nay if he had periſhed in the encounter, ſo he had carried Victory out of the World with him, he would have thought himſelf crowned with an high ſatisfaction. He would have thought that he dyed more happily then Cowards live; and that it was more glorious thus to end his dayes, then to ſpin them out baſely to the longeſt Age.
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:101895:145"/>Beſides, herein there being ſo conſiderable a proof of the ſincerity and fidelity of ſuch perſons unto God, it cannot but pleaſe them very much to reflect upon it. It yields them a great joy to remember that they have his approbation, and that after many fiery tryals, he finds that they are not indued with a counterfeit Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Nay, it is ſome joy to think that their enemies judge them ſo conſiderable, as to raiſe ſuch mighty forces againſt them, and fight ſo many battels with them. They aſſure them hereby, that they are more in their account, than they could wiſh. And that power which gave them a ſhock, but could not ſhake them, doth demonſtrate the ſolidity of their ſouls, and the great ſtrength they have to reſiſt ſuch forcible impreſſions.</p>
               <p>I do not know whether it be a tale or no, but I have been told that among other wayes, the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> tryed the wiſdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> by offering certain Boys and Girles to be diſtinguiſht one from the other by him, when they were put into the very ſame garb and had been taught the ſame geſtures and carriage of their bodies: And that he calling for ſome cold water, commanded them all to waſh themſelves. Into which the youths plunging their hands boldly, and then rubbing their faces very hard; and the others tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dipping their fingers, and only ſleaking their faces over with it; he ſoon diſcerned the difference, and ſeparated them according to their ſexes. Hardſhips will make a true proof of the ſtrength and maſculine force of our ſpirits. Proſperity (as a wiſe man of later times obſerves) doth beſt diſcover Vice, and Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity makes the beſt diſcovery of Vertue. And as the one is not without many fears and diſtaſts; ſo the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:101895:146"/>other is not without its hopes and comforts: of which this is not the leaſt, that <hi>God thinks us worthy to be the men, in whom he would make an Experiment, what Chriſtian ſouls are able to ſuffer.</hi> The Vertue of Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is Temperance, and the Vertue of Adverſity is Fortitude; which in the account of all the world is the more Heroical of the two, and yields the greateſt Triumphs. Nay, He fears not to ſay, that Proſperity is the bleſſing of the Old Teſtament, and Adverſity is the bleſſing of the New, which carries the greater be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction, and the clearer revelation of Gods favour. And therefore do not take that ill, which to ſuch a man as you is a mark of the Divine Love. Be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing that God ſhould do you an honour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon you a bleſſing. Let him have the pleaſure of ſeeing you behave your ſelf gallantly. Deny him not that ſpectacle which is not to be had in Heaven, and for which he manifeſted himſelf in fleſh. Let it not repent him of his choice, if he pick out you for ſome notable Combate. The General appoints the ſtouteſt men for the hardeſt ſervices. And they do not ſay. He bears an ill will to us, and owes us a ſpite; but he hath an high opinion of us, and intends to do us cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. Do you now iſſue forth with an heart full of the ſame thoughts, and take my word you ſhall never want the nobleſt pleaſures. You will thank God for placing you in the foremoſt rank of Chriſtian Souldiers. You will praiſe him for eſteeming a poor Pilgrim capable of ſuch atchievements. You will rejoyce to ſee your ſelf herein preferred before the Angels: For if they can do more than you, yet you can ſuffer more than they. Nay, you will find your ſelf in the fellowſhip of the Son of God, who was never ſo glorious as when he hung upon the Croſs; never triumphed ſo much as
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:101895:146"/>when he ſeemed to be trampled under feet; and then ſpoiled principalities and powers, when he was robb'd of all, and loſt even life it ſelf.</p>

               <head type="sub">How the Pilgrim and his Guide parted. And with what a brave Reſolution he began his Journey.</head>
               <p>WHen the Good <hi>Father</hi> (for ſo we will hereafter call him) had ſaid thoſe words with ſome other to the ſame effect; he told him, that now he thought it would be an injurious act to hinder him any longer by his diſcourſes, from going to prove the truth of what had been ſaid. If I am a <hi>Mercury</hi> (continued he with a little ſmile) as you have been pleaſed to fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, I may have leave to make uſe of my wings and fly away. There remains nothing now to be done, but that which I cannot do for you; and the greateſt cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie that is left in my power, is to keep you no longer from doing it your ſelf. Whereupon, after he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted him briefly to be ſtrong in the Grace of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and to endure hardſhip as a good Souldier of his, He bade him heartily farewel, and put himſelf into a poſture of departing. But the <hi>Pilgrim</hi> being ſorely afflicted within himſelf at this news, ſuddenly caught hold of his Garment which gently moved towards him as he turned about; and in a conteſt between joy and grief, uttered theſe words, as well as thoſe paſſions would give him leave. Let me intreat you, Dear Sir, to prolong your patience ſo far, as before you go away to receive my thanks for the good Directions you have furniſhed me withall; and to give your Bleſſing like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:101895:147"/>upon a poor heart that is reſolved by the help of Heaven inſtantly to ſet forth in this way which you have deſcribed. If I had been born your Son, I could not have thought my obligations greater to you, than now I feel them. Nay, I ſhall take the liberty to ſay, That I ſtand more indebted to your Piety, than I do to Nature. For fancy oft-times makes Parents, but it is only reaſon, truth and goodneſs which have tyed my heart to you. And therefore ſince I am the iſſue of your mind, you may juſtly expect a greater reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, love and obedience to your commands, than if I was the iſſue of your body. I have heard your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe Sir, with great attention; I have markt every particular paſſage of it with diligence and care; and ſuch a guſt hath every word given me which dropt from your mouth, that it hath ſeemed to me not many minutes long. It is not to be expreſſed how your Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Sentence pleaſeth me, which you have put into my mouth. I am reſolved to go along this Journey chaunting it continually, with no leſs delight than the Birds are wont to do their Melodies. Nay, I cannot forbear (and be not weary, I beſeech you Sir, if I hold you longer than I thought) but I muſt here before you renounce my own proper will, and proteſt that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire nothing but to be what <hi>Jeſus</hi> would have me, and to be where <hi>Jeſus,</hi> you ſay, will bring me. O thou ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of God! my ſelf-will, that haſt reigned ſo long, come down from thy Throne. I proclaim War againſt thee, and am reſolved from this day forward to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all thy deſires. I ſet my ſelf here in open defiance to thee; I will have no peace with thee for one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; becauſe thou-art no friend of God, to whom I now deliver my ſelf. Let him be pleaſed to come and reign in my heart, for I am abſolutely his. May it be
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:101895:147"/>his will to accept of a poor Slave, that devotes all his powers to his ſervice. This I will beg of him perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, that he would vouchſafe to let me know what his will is; and that ſhall be my Guide, though my own will be never ſo deſirous to hold a contrary courſe. Let it pain me, or let it pleaſe me, I am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to bind my ſelf faſt to God; that he may carry me not whither I would, but whither himſelf thinks good. Say the word, O my God, and it is enough: I am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to be conducted by thee. Lead me whither thou wilt, O thou bleſſed Providence; thou ſhalt have a faithful follower of thy wiſe Counſels. I am no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger affraid of any dangers. Thoſe terrible Monſters, Poverty, Reproach, and all the reſt, do ſtrike no dread at all into me. Farewell offices and honours, if you muſt be the recompence of crimes. Farewell my friends, if I muſt be the companion of your ſins. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well all the world, if it muſt be the price of my ſoul. But as for you Sir, I am loath to bid you farewell. I muſt be ſnatched, rather than go from your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. For you are my Father, my Oracle, a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſent from God to bring me to him. And if you will go to Heaven without me, I pray you once more to receive my acknowledgements, which teſtifie that I would thank you if I were able, both for your former Directions, and for this Patience.</p>
               <p>Truly (replyed the Father) I think my ſelf rather obliged to thank you moſt heartily that you would come to me, and being come, that you would hear me not only with Patience, but Acceptance. For there is nothing, I am ſo greedy of, as to meet with a ſoul that is ſincerely deſirous to know the way to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> neither do I know any pleaſure equal
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:101895:148"/>to that of pouring out my heart into ſuch thirſty minds, unleſs it be this of ſeeing them relliſh thoſe Waters of Life which flow from Wiſdome's lips. And that ſame <hi>Jeſus</hi> who, I ſee, hath touched your heart al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready with his Love, and excited you to take this Journey; give you his Bleſſing, and ſend his Spirit the Comforter to accompany you in your travels, and aſſign you to ſome good Angel of his that may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you to that happy place, the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> where he lives. In the way to which I am ſo deſirous you ſhould enter, that I will not be your hinderance by any further diſcourſes; but ſhall be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad, as I told you, to find you in ſafety arrived there, where we ſhall never part more, nor have any cauſe to ſay this ſad word, Farewell.</p>
               <p>Muſt I part then with you, ſaid the <hi>Pilgrim?</hi>—Here he made a pauſe, and tears ſpoke the reſt of his mind: for I could hear never a word he ſaid, till after a great many ſighs hee thus proceeded: Well, let it be ſo. It is part of my duty, you ſay, to be contented with every thing. And therefore I now freely reſume my former reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſay in the words (I hope in the Spirit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo) of Jeſus, <hi>Not my will, O Lord, but thy Will be done.</hi> Onely let me again renew my deſires that you would accompany me ever with your good Prayers, for I hope it is not too great a grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of my ſelf to be pleaſed in your friendſhip, and in the belief that you remember me: Nor will it be accounted a crime that I am not willing to be left out of your thoughts, eſpecially when they are addreſſed in devout ſupplications to <hi>Jeſus.</hi> I have been long perſwaded that I uſe to proſper the better in all my
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:101895:148"/>deſignes for the good wiſhes of pious perſons: and it hath been ſome ſupport to me alſo when I have had no great ſtore of good deſires in my own heart, or been but cold in thoſe I had, to think that the concerns of my ſoul were preſented to God by ſome Friend or other, in their more fervent Devotions. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will be at the moſt but a pardonable error, if I do with ſome Paſſion beg the prayers of ſuch a perſon as you are, and if I comfort my ſelf ſometimes with the intereſs I have in you and them. Eſpecially ſince I ſee by your charitable inſtructions, and the patience you have uſed towards me, that you have an heart ſo full of Love and Goodneſs, that it will neither ſuffer you to remember me coldly, nor to be weary in recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to the Grace of God.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Father</hi> would not make any long reply to theſe words, for fear they ſhould never break off, but be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes linkt together by the chains of this pleaſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and the delight which he perceived began to ſpring up in him by the interchanging ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of their mutual Love. But after he had aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him by a ſolemn promiſe that he would never fail to commend him to the love and care of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> they took their leave one of the other, not without a great many embraces, and hearty wiſhes to ſee each other again in peace at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may be ſure the <hi>Pilgrim</hi> could not but often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect with a ſad heart upon this dear perſon whoſe counſels he carried along with him in his breaſt. And while the image of him was ſo freſh in his mind, it did not a little wound him that he could enjoy no more then that ſhaddow of his friend. Sometimes he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:101895:149"/>Plained of the imperfections of this ſtate and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of the world, that will not let thoſe who love moſt, be moſt together. Sometimes he blamed his own unworthineſs, which made ſuch a felicity as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant company of ſo good a man too great for him to poſſeſs. Sometimes he called him back and wiſhed in his heart that he would return. And by and by he was ready to follow after him and thought he could fly preſently into his embraces; ſo ſtrong were the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires he felt of being with him. But in the midſt of theſe reſtleſs thoughts which for a little ſpace were toſſed up and down in his mind; It pleaſed God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him of the Vow he had made of his will to him. He put him in mind that he ſtood ſtill all this while, though he was in ſo great an agitation, and that to follow his Friend would be to go back from his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and that he had more then the image of his body to bear him company, there being left behind the very picture of his ſoul deſcribed in thoſe Directions which he had beſtowed upon him. Such thoughts as theſe put away that fit of paſſion wherein he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, and cauſed the qualm that went over his heart to vaniſh. So that now looſned from all the world (as he thought) he bleſſed himſelf, and without any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure took his ſtaff in his hand and ſaid: From this moment farewell all my former enjoyments; Do not trouble me; for I now begin my deſigned Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. <hi>I am nought, I have nought, I deſire nought but to be with Jeſus at Jeruſalem.</hi>

               <head type="sub">Of ſundry troubles which hapned to the Pilgrim in his Travels. And how he was delivered out of them.</head>
               <p>A Fine Sunſhine-morning it was when he firſt went out of his doors; The Air was perfumed with the ſweet Odors which the Sun exhaled from the flowers, the birds whiſtled and ſung their Hymns to him that made that glorious Light; and there was no hedge that he paſſed by, but it welcomed him with ſome new Songs and pleaſures, nor any Traveller he met, but wiſhed him, Good ſpeed. He was ſo much pleaſed in every thing that he ſaw and heard, in all the Works of God, in his Word which he bare in his Mind, in the ſmoothneſs of the Way, in the remembrance of the Father he left, in the aſſurance he had of his Prayers and ſuch like things, that he never thought himſelf at home, till now that he had no home at all, but was ſeeking one. He could do nothing but compoſe Praiſes to God; nothing but laud the Name of Jeſus that had brought him into ſo happy a condition; and by his good will he would have made this the buſineſs of all the day to ſing a certain Ditty, the beginning and the end of which (I remember) was nothing but this, <hi>Bleſs the Lord O my Soul.</hi> Whether it was the novelty of thoſe Objects that preſented themſelves, or the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Beauty of them, or the good Society he met withall, or an immediate touch from that Spirit which the Good man pray'd might be his Companion, or all theſe, or any other thing, that made him ſo merry, I had not leiſure to examine; but he was never known in all
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:101895:150"/>his life to have expreſſed ſo much contentment in any condition, as in this Pilgrimage wherein he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet he had not paſſed many weeks in theſe raptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous joys (for they were little leſs) before he found them ſo much abated that he thought himſelf leſs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py then he imagined. The wayes were grown a little more rugged, the Heaven began to be overcaſt, and the Country through which he went was more barren and yielded not thoſe Fruits which he had before taſted; which together with other things caſt him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a damp, and procured to his ſoul more ſadneſs then he uſed to be acquainted withall. At the firſt indeed he was only moved to ſome wonderment to find ſuch an alteration, and thought that in half a dayes travel or ſuch a ſpace, he ſhould recover more pleaſant paths. But when he found contrary to his expectation that they ſtill continued uneaſie, and likewiſe chanced to ſee ſome of his old Companions who called to him at ſome diſtance and perſwaded him to go back again; he was much affrighted, and began to feel wild imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations roving about his Soul, and ſtrange deſires of quitting a courſe which was like to prove ſo ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to that part of him which was moſt concerned in the things of this World. For it was repreſented to his thoughts that the enſuing part of the rode was very dangerous, beſet with Theeves and many Difficulties, tedious and of a ſtrange length; and, beſides that he might be in a wrong way, it was very doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was ſuch a place or no as he fancied, ſeeing no body had been there. From all which and many other conſiderations they told him it was moſt adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able if he conſulted his own peace to return with
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:101895:150"/>them to his former habitation and his ancient neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: who were all very ſorry to hear that he had quit his preſent poſſeſſions, in they knew not what hopes of getting better at a place which neither he nor any of his friends had ſeen.</p>
               <p>But though this Puſh by the unexpectedneſs of it made him reel and ſtagger a little, yet he ſoon recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected himſelf: and calling to mind what he had been taught, and repeating that charm (as I may call it) which he alwayes had about him, <hi>I am nought, I have nought, &amp;c.</hi> he found himſelf as firm in his reſolution as if he had not been at all aſſaulted. Shall I forſake my Lord (ſaid he to himſelf) ſo ſoon as ever I have begun his ſervice? Is it handſome for me to recoil, meerly from the noiſe and report of dangers? What a Coward ſhall I for ever hold my ſelf, if I run away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my enemies be in view, upon a rumour of their ſtrength and power? I will march up towards them, and at leaſt look them in the face. I will not truſt this Fame which all the world hath branded for a Lyar: Since common obſervation alſo tells us, that the Lyon is not ſo terrible as he is painted. Much more he ſpake to this effect, which moved him to a kind of indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt himſelf that he ſhould ſo much as ſhrink back thus early, before ſufficient tryal, and upon ſuch ſleight information.</p>
               <p>And yet it was not at all to his diſadvantage that he had felt this ſhock, but it rather had many happy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects upon him: like a fit or two of an Ague, which is thought rather wholeſome, then to deſerve the name of a Diſeaſe. For as it gave him more underſtanding in the nature of his way (of the ſmoothneſs of which
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:101895:151"/>notwithſtanding all that had been ſaid, he too much preſumed) and made him watchful becauſe he ſaw he could not paſs without ſome enemies: So it gave him ſome degree of courage, becauſe he perceived they might be overcome, and confirm'd his belief of the Wiſdom of his Director who foretold theſe troubles; and gave a proof withall of the efficacy of that Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which he had preſcribed, and above all revived that Joy and gladneſs in his heart which he thought began to languiſh and faint away. Full of joy he was even to an exceſs, and he ſuffered by it a kind of tranſportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; partly from the brightneſs of the Truths he had received, which yet were freſh in his mind; partly from the increaſe of his underſtanding by the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment which he had made; but chiefly I think from the Victory which he had obtained over thoſe enemies that attacqued his Soul. For in truth, there is no greater Triumph then that which the Soul feels when it comes off a Conquerour; and applauds it ſelf for the Valour and Courage which it hath expreſſed in its conflicts. There was another thing indeed which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſomething though not much to his joy, <hi>viz.</hi> that ded ſomething though not much to his joy, <hi>viz.</hi> that his enemies he hoped had received ſuch a foil, that he had ſent them away diſcouraged if not diſabled, from making any further attempts upon him.</p>
               <p>But ſo mutable is our condition here, and ſo many are our enemies, that he had not travelled many dayes after this Triumph, before he was arreſted with a new trouble to exerciſe his Wiſdom and Patience. His ſoul which juſt now was ready to leap out of his body, he felt to ſink ſo low, that it was as if he had no ſoul at all. His ſpirits not only began to flagg and hang down their heads; but were grown quite faint and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:101895:151"/>weary, as if they meant to ſwoon away. Which was partly occaſioned by his going too faſt, and taking over-long Journeys; and partly by a very hot day, when the Sun beat very ſtrongly upon his head; and partly by the very violence of his joyes which ſtirred his ſpirits ſo much, that in the agitation they flew away; and partly by letting ſlip two or three of thoſe Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which had been left with him which ſhould have been a Cordial to him, but were as impoſſible he found to be by any means recalled, as it was to bring back his tyred ſpirits which were flown from him. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry melancholly and ſad he now began to be, and the more becauſe he had been ſo joyful. O how deſolate (ſaid he within himſelf) is this place into which I am faln! I am forſaken ſure of God, or elſe I that was ſo high yeſterday, ſhould never have ſunk into this pit, which is next door to the dwelling of damned ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Was ever any man in ſuch a deplorable eſtate? Was there ever any bereaved thus of all his comforts which ſhould ſweeten his way when he hath no other company? Oh Who, will reſtore unto me the dayes that are paſt? Who can call back but the joyes of yeſterday into my boſome? What are thoſe ſins that have caſt me into the diſpleaſure of my Lord? Or, What ſhall I do to regain his favour, which I would purchaſe at any rate, though I dyed the next moment? Thus he lay many dayes, ſometimes bewailing his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer affrightment, which he ſuſpected might deſerve this deſertion (as he was apt to call it) ſometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining that he could not find the cauſe, and ſo could not be cured; ſometimes reflecting on the times of joy which were gone; and ſometimes taking a view of his miſery, which made him but the more deeply miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. And, which was worſt of all, he kept his bed
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:101895:152"/>all this time, and ſtirred not a foot in his Journey; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed ſo ill, that he deſpaired of life.</p>
               <p>But ſee how the Providence of God watches for an opportune ſeaſon to do us a kindneſs. When he was in the greateſt torture that he had felt all the time of this Agony, there came an unexpected Letter to his hands from his beloved Father, which was to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>

               <p>Upon the very firſt receipt of this Letter, before he had broke it up, his pale cheeks began to be ſtreaked
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:101895:152"/>with a little blood, as a prognoſtick of his recovery to health again. But when he opened it, and read the kind expreſſions of the Love of his Friend, one might ſee how the ſpirits crept up as he went along, out of the Center whither they were retired: In ſo much that the light danced in his eyes, yea leaped out as if it meant to kiſs thoſe lines which now ſaluted them. But then, as ſoon as he arrived at the Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelf, and had carefully peruſed all the parts of it; his face ſhined like an Angel, and one would have thought he had not been the man that was ſo lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. For it was ſo pat to his preſent condition, and ſo exactly ſuted to the neceſſities under which he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, that it ſeemed as if it had been indicted by God, and not by his Friend. There he found a diſcourſe of the Nature of Joy, of the cauſes of its decay, of the Intereſs that our Animal Spirits have in it, of the way to recover it, and the means to be content without it, and above all, of the Reſignation of our ſelves to the Will of God, to ſerve him chearfully without thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible pleaſures, as well as in their company. And not to name other things which were more fully debated between them afterward; theſe now rehearſed were ſo fully opened, that he was partly amazed, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly elevated to the height of his Joyes again, when he thought that God had put it into the heart of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> to ſend at this time a Letter of ſuch comfortable import unto him. I ſee, ſaid the <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> that not my Friend only, but Jeſus alſo is mindful of me. I ſee both that He prayes for me, and that Heaven likewiſe hears thoſe Prayers. It would be an unſufferable wrong to my Bleſſed Saviour, ſhould I hereafter think my ſoul forſaken of him. Nay, it will be an ill requital of the favour he hath now done me; ſhould I not reſume my
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:101895:153"/>ancient joyfulneſs again. And therefore be no longer diſquieted O my Soul, be not caſt down within me. It is not in vain to hope in God, but in that very hope thou mayeſt be joyful: and therefore in the fruition of thy expectations, O how greatly oughteſt thou to rejoyce.<note place="margin">Pſa. 97.11</note>

               </p>
               <p>Many other the like effuſions of his heart, one might then have heard, and they laſted ſo many dayes, that they became inſtrumental to the redeeming much of that time which had been loſt in fruitleſs complaints upon his bed. He did not go ſo faſt as he was wont, but he went much further than before in the ſame number of hours. His Joyes were not ſo violent, but they became more ſweet, and they grew more equal. He could not recover yet the Memory of ſome things he had received; but this he better underſtood, that he muſt deſire nought but <hi>Jeſus.</hi> He was not ſo full of heat, but his light was more reſplendent. He did not expect now to be alwayes in the ſame temper, yet he was confident he ſhould never more ſuſpect the Love of his Saviour. He perceived that he could not ever retain the ſame Joyes, yet he learnt withall, that the way to have them ſooner reſtored, was not to fret for want of them.</p>
               <p>But though in this condition he made a great progreſs
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:101895:153"/>his way towards the Holy City of God; yet the light which was in his mind, did not caſt ſuch a ſplendour about his ſoul, but that one day he ſuffered ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity. The occaſion of it was a cloudy thought which came over his underſtanding, ſuggeſting to him; <hi>That he did not ſerve God purely enough, becauſe his eye was too much upon Jeruſalem.</hi> For it had been common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received for a Truth among ſome perſons whom he had formerly converſed withall, That we muſt obey God out of meer Love to him, without any hope of rewards at all. This, you will ſay, was a ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and it had as ſtrange a cure. For it pleaſed God, that he opening a Book which he carried along with him, the next morning after theſe thoughts troubled him; the firſt thing that he caſt his eye upon was this paſſage in a certain Chapter of it, <hi>That Moſes had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the recompence of reward.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11.29</note> You cannot think how much it ſurpriſed him, that he ſhould light upon theſe words rather than any other, without his choice or ſo much as a deſign to receive ſatisfaction in this particular. And yet that which I am next to relate was more wonderful in his eyes, and made him ſtand in a greater aſtoniſhment at the goodneſs of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. For it being ſuggeſted to him from the memory of ſome fragments of certain Sermons which he once heard, <hi>That Moſes and thoſe under the Law who were but Bondmen, might have reſpect to Rewards, but that it did not become thoſe who had the Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be ſo Mercenary;</hi> and he being a little perplexed with this trifling Objection; It happened, that looking down upon the ſame page of his Book again, his eye fell directly upon the ſecond Verſe of the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which told him, That <hi>Jeſus endured the Croſs for the Joy that was ſet before him.</hi> The firſt glance which he
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:101895:154"/>had of this place, was like a Beam of the Sun in his eye, which immediately diſpelled all his darkneſs, and made his ſoul flaſh out in ſuch expreſſions as theſe. Who are theſe men that are wiſer than Jeſus? What mean theſe dreamers to fancy themſelves above that, which was not below our Saviour? Or how came they to be ſo proud as to deſpiſe the Promiſes of God, and think they ſtand in no need at all of them? On, my ſoul, go on, and be not ſtopt a minute longer by this ſcruple. Fix thine eyes upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and let thine heart be raviſhed with it; for the Mediatour of the ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as well as of the firſt had a reſpect unto it.</p>
               <p>After he had hit ſo luckily on theſe two paſſages which lay ſo near together, a great many more of the ſame kind preſented themſelves inſtantly to his mind: not much unlike the Beams of the Sun, which having once torn a cloud in ſunder, break forth more and more, till the whole body of that great light appear to us. And this likewiſe raiſed his ſpirits unto ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degree of chearfulneſs, when he thought how our Lord ſtill provided for his relief, and took the pains to pull the ſmalleſt Thorn that troubled him out of his feet. And yet this could not hinder but that they were too much dejected a little after by a company of other petty thoughts, which, like ſo many importune Flyes, were alwayes buzzing this new fancy in his ears; <hi>That he did not directly intend the glory and honour of Jeſus in all his Actions.</hi> He conſidered indeed with himſelf, that he endeavoured to do well, and that he he loved to do ſo, and that he lookt upon it as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Life of God; but yet he thought he did not ſo <hi>actually</hi> reſpect him in every particular motion as his
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:101895:154"/>duty required. Now here it fell out very happily, and not without a Divine Providence, as he thought, that one night being in a dream, he imagined he ſaw one coming to him, and whiſper this ſentence in his ear, which of a long time he had not read,<note place="margin">Rev. 19.9</note> 
                  <hi>They repented not, to give him Glory.</hi> Whereupon ſtarting ſuddenly out of his ſleep, as if ſome good <hi>Genius</hi> had awakened him, and given him a new mind, he preſently began to tell himſelf, that when he firſt <hi>repented,</hi> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took this New Life, he <hi>gave Glory to God:</hi> and that by every ſtep he took in this courſe of <hi>Repentance</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> amending of himſelf) he did <hi>actually</hi> honour him, and more materially than any other way gloriſie his name: For this is a conſtant acknowledgement of him, a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely confeſſion that we are fools, and he is wiſe; that our will is nought, and his is good; that he is our Lord, and we his Subjects; and that after all our ſearch we find our Happineſs to lye in him alone, and in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from him, the beſt condition in the world will leave us miſerable. And he had not long pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered upon theſe things with much ſatisfaction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe words of the Pſalmiſt came into his mind, <hi>He that offereth praiſe, glorifieth me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 50.21</note> 
                  <hi>and to him that ordereth his converſation aright, will I ſhew the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God.</hi> Which made him fall into the praiſes of God, and to reſolve that he would do ſo every day, and early deſign all the imployments of it to his ſervice: concluding, that whilſt he held this courſe, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his wayes aright, he exalted God in the world; by lifting up his Will into a preheminence and command over his own, &amp; ſubjecting himſelf unto it both as moſt ſupreme, and alſo wiſe and good. And after a great many thoughts of this nature, at laſt he made a ſhort reflection upon the perſon who had made him this
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:101895:155"/>viſit in the night. And when he remembred that he fancied it was his Friend who came to his Bed-ſide, he had a new pleaſure to think of the benefits of Sleep. The praiſes of which he could not upon this occaſion forbear, though at certain times he wiſhed his thoughts might never be intermitted by it. What an heavenly power (ſaid he) is this, for ſo I am ready to call it? how much am I beholden to it for its ſilent refreſhments? That which uſeth to part the deareſt friends, hath now brought them together. That which ſeparateth thoſe who touch each other, hath made thoſe near who are far aſunder. O Divine Gift! O beloved Reſt which God beſtows upon us! How great are theſe charms which lock our doors to all the World and now have opened them to my friend? How much better are theſe dreams then many of my waking thoughts? How much rather had I be in the arms of the brother of death, then in the feeble injoyments of many parts of my life? I am content juſt now to be reſtored to his embraces, if my Friend will but meet me there again in this manner. At leaſt I hope I may conclude that when we are Dead indeed, he will not fail to meet me; whoſe Image finds me out when I am in the Images of death.</p>

               <head type="sub">How the Pilgrim fell into a great ſadneſs; and how ſtrangely it was cured by an unexpected meeting with his Guide. Who diſcourſes of the nature of ſenſible joyes. And at laſt upon his deſire contracts a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Friendſhip</hi> with the Pilgrim.</head>
               <p>IN ſuch thoughts or rather dreams as theſe he ſpent a little portion of his time with great delight. And now having vanquiſhed ſo many enemies and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his way of divers ſorts, he was willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he ſhould be moleſted no more, but paſs in perfect peace to the <hi>Viſion of Peace.</hi> A great many dayes he remained in theſe pleaſant expectations, and went a good way onwards to his reſting place, without the leaſt wearineſs of any part about him. He ſeldome departed from meditation but either with his mind illuminated with new light from heaven, or his will inflamed with a new ardor, or his whole heart ſteeped in new ſweetneſs. And though ſundry new enemies alſo attempted him, yet ſuch a profound peace ſeemed to have taken poſſeſſion of his heart, that they could not move the leaſt diſturbance there. The joyes that he felt made him deſpiſe all baits of pleaſure which lay in his way. The Conqueſts which he had got, made him think himſelf above the ſcorn and laughter of the World. And though he was ſometimes bitterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, yet he comforted himſelf with this that they did but prepare him matter for new triumphs. But he could never be drawn to any other conteſts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Generality of men were then very zealouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged:
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:101895:156"/>nor did he affect any Victories among the diſputers of the World. He lived in love and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs with all his fellow-travellers. He thought himſelf ſo rich alſo in theſe graces, that it was no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him to be poor. And he had ſuch a ſenſe from whence he received them, that they were no temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on neither to be proud. But yet for all this it chanced that ſome exerciſes of Devotion to which he had bound himſelf being one day omitted, either through indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, or by reaſon of ſome lawful if not neceſſary occaſions which diverted him; he was caſt into ſuch a penſiveneſs of mind as proved at laſt a great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him. For he indulged to himſelf thoſe thoughts becauſe they pleaſed him at firſt; but by too frequent reflections they grew to a melancholy mood, and from thence proceeded to a dull and liſtleſs temper of Spirit. In this condition you muſt needs think his joyes were again abated, which added very much to the trouble of his mind: and indeed they fell in time to ſo low an ebb, that he feared they would never riſe again, but leave him at laſt quite dry and without one drop of comfort. And ſo truly in the iſſue of things it proved: for as they forſook him, ſo he was tempted again to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his way, which was now become but irkſome to him without thoſe refreſhments. The pleaſure and relliſh that he was wont to feel in holy duties was quite gone. In ſtead of clearneſs there ſucceeded darkneſs; dryneſs of ſpirit took the place of affection; and in the room of joy and gladneſs he was loaded with nothing but groans and heavineſs. He often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that he could feel nothing at all; but remained as a man that had loſt the uſe of his ſoul. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though he continued for a while to pray and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his duty in other things as well as he could, yet
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:101895:156"/>finding that he was but like a man that drinks very much, when the liquor hath no taſt, and gives him no pleaſure in the going down; he was tempted to throw it all away, and thought he had as good not do thoſe things at all as do them with no delight. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he gave up himſelf wholly to be tortured by his own thoughts, which imployed themſelves in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but making ſad repreſentations of the miſery of this ſtate: which you muſt needs think was ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous that it is not poſſible to draw a picture of it. For ſince the ſoul is of far greater force then the body; the pains and anguiſh which ariſes in it, muſt needs be far more pungent and afflictive then thoſe which touch the outward man. He ſuffered a kind of Martyrdom every day: or rather he was continually crucified and had nothing but Gall and Vinegar given him to drink. He thought he had reaſon when he complained of greater pains then the Martyrs endured. For they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inwardly illuminated and touched from heaven, found the higheſt comforts in their torments, the greateſt liberty in their impriſonments, and in the midſt of flames the divineſt ardors of Love in their hearts which like a greater fire put the other out. But he poor Soul, though alwayes denying his own deſires, breaking of his will in pieces, lying upon a rack, and faſt nailed to the Croſs where the body of ſin was bleeding to death; yet found his Spirit in horrid tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and deprived of thoſe divine delights, which cheared the bright ſouls of the bleſſed Martyrs, and made them ſhine with a greater luſter then did their fires. But ſince I cannot expreſs the ſoreneſs of this Agony in which he a long time lay; I ſhall only add that it was ſo great, that one day being quite tired and ſpent; he fell into a kind of trance, and remained as
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:101895:157"/>immoveable for ſome ſpace, as if he had been dead. And a bleſſed occaſion this was; though all his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance that were come to comfort him, imagined he would then have expired. For he thought he ſaw a man coming to him with a very ſmiling aſpect (as though he knew him) who bad him get up, and go as faſt as he could to a certain Oratory that was not far off, and in his way; where he ſhould meet with ſome relief.</p>
               <p>When he was come to himſelf; he thought this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (or what elſe you pleaſe to call it) was in ſtead of an Oracle, and had diſcovered to him one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt cauſes that he continued ſo long ill of theſe grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous diſtempers. And that was; <hi>That while he afflicted and tormented himſelf with the remembrance of what was paſſed; he neglected to implore the help of God with ſuch conſtant prayers as was nieet, for the redreſs of his preſent evils, and prevention of the like in time to come.</hi> This began to make a vehement commotion in his mind; for he ſaw there was nothing truer, then that <hi>We are apt to pray leaſt, when we have greateſt need of it; and are wont to ſpend that time in looking upon our ſores, which ſhould be imployed in looking up to Heaven, for its Balm to drop into them.</hi> And truly ſo lively were the colours wherein this was ſet before his eyes; that he was ready to burſt into tears and pour out his Soul there, before he ſtir'd from the bed whereon he lay. But remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring preſently the voyce (to which he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo much beholden) had bid him make what ſpeed he could to a particular place, where he might addreſs his prayers to his Saviour; he aroſe and dreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without any further delay. And though he knew that our Lord hears the ſuits of his humble Clients
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:101895:157"/>every where, yet he would not be diſobedient to the directions he had received; but made haſte to go and ſee what good might wait for him in that Oratory or Chappel which had been built in the rode by ſome charitable perſon, for the uſe of devout paſſengers to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And no ſooner had he entred within the doors but he fell upon his knees; and there ſent out his Soul in ſuch ſtrong and paſſionate deſires, as left all words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; which were not able to accompany them. If the throng of his thoughts (which upon this occaſion were aſſembled) had not been ſo great, you might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a better account of them. But truly ſuch was the violence wherewith they preſſed forth and ſo great were their numbers, that he found it very difficult either then to range them in any order, or afterward to recall them diſtinctly to his mind. Yet ſome of them carried this ſenſe, as I have been certainly informed by him from whom he hides none of the ſecrets of his Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O thou Almighty Goodneſs, the Father of the Fatherleſs, the Patron of the Poor, the Protector of Strangers; caſt thy gracious eyes upon a miſerable Pilgrim, who all torn and ragged implores thy mercy. When I look on my ſelf I dare ſcarce be ſo bold as to lift up mine eyes unto thee. When I think in what condition I am and what I have done, it ſo confounds me; that I can hardly think of any thing elſe. It is the greatneſs of my miſery alone that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains me to this preſumption of proſtrating my ſelf at thy feet. The weight of which oppreſſes me ſo much, that it hath left me little more power, then to expoſe my ſelf before thee, as an object of thy wondrous Charity. O what
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:101895:158"/>a Wilderneſs am I faln into where I can find no water! What Deſarts are theſe, in which all comfort forſakes my Soul! Into what strange regions am I wandred, where there is nothing but darkneſs, and the vallies of the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death! O the terrors that ſurround me! how dreadful are they? O the affliction and torment which I indure! what tongue can expreſs it? my Soul is parcht and dryed up. My ſpirits are conſumed by the heat of thy diſpleaſure. May I not now beg one drop of comfort from thee?— O my God, my ſoul thirsteth for thee, my fleſh longeth for thee in a dry and barren land. I remember thy loving kindneſs in former times: I call to mind the dayes of old: And I cannot but wiſh at leaſt, to ſee thy power and thy glory ſo as I have ſeen thee in the Sanctuary. There is none in Heaven that I deſire but thee, nor on earth beſides thee. My Soul followeth hard after thee: O when wilt thou come unto me? O hide not thy face from thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, for I am in trouble: hear me ſpeedily. I am poor and needy, make haſte unto me O God: thou art my helper and deliverer; O Lord, make no tarrying. I am come a great way from all my friends and kindred, and there is none to pitty me. O my God, be not thou far from me: draw nigh unto my ſoul and redeem it. I am poor and ſorrowful: let thy Salvation ſet me up on high. For thou who ſearchest the hearts knoweſt, that I am travelling no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whither but to thee. All the world have I left, that I may find my happineſs only in thee. And at thy heavenly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it was, that I undertook this long journey. I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Pilgrim meerly in obedience to thy Will. Yea thus far I acknowledge thou hast most graciouſly conducted me. Hitherto I have been highly favoured and wonderfully helped by thee. And wilt thou now at last abandon me, who have ahandon'd all things elſe for the ſake of thee? Haſt thou called me from mine own Country and Fathers
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:101895:158"/>houſe, that I may periſh by famine here; and only for want of thee? O my Lord, give me leave to plead for a Soul which once I thought was dear unto thee. Pitty, O pitty an Heart, which thou haſt made too great for all the World and cannot be ſatisfied with leſs than thee. Canſt thou ſee it dye for lack of one ſmile from thee? yea, canſt thou let it dye of love to thee? for that hath brought me thus far to ſeek thee. And wilt thou ſuffer it to dye at thy feet? Canst thou endure to behold it periſh in thy arms, into which it now throws it ſelf with all the force it hath? Shall it miſcarry full of prayers and longing after thee? Shall it expire in cryes and tears which it pours out for thy mercy? O where are thy Bowels? what are become of thine antient loving-kindneſſes? Are they all forfeited by one offence againſt thee? O my God I cannot think ſo hardly of thee. I begin to live me thinks, becauſe thou permitteſt theſe adreſſes to thee. It inſpires me with ſome hopes to find theſe holy breathings in me. It rejoyces me much that I feel thee drawing my very heart after thee. O take it, I beſeech thee, take it quite away from me unto thy ſelf. Shape it after thine own heart; and make it ſuch as thou canſt imbrace. Create in me a clean heart O God, and renew in me a right ſpirit. Cast me not away from thy preſence and take not thy holy Spirit from me. Reſtore unto me the joy of thy Salvation; and uphold me with thy free Spirit.</hi>

               <p>He was proceeding in the words of that Penitential Pſalm, being once got into it; but that a flood of tears ſtopt the paſſage of his words, and ſighs and groans ſupplyed their place. In which having vented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a while; it fell out that the tyde of his paſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little faln and his ſighs growing ſomething ſilent; he ſhould hear the voyce of another perſon that was drowned before in his lowder cryes; which invited
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:101895:159"/>him firſt to liſten and then to caſt his eyes, as wet as they were, that way from whence it came to his ears. And ſo turning his head a little aſide, who ſhould he eſpy in this Oratory but the Good man from whom he had taken his firſt Directions; who being himſelf alſo a Traveller to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> called in at this place to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh himſelf, and to take ſuch a repaſt as the bounty of Heaven was wont here to provide. He ſearce knew at the firſt whether he might believe his eyes or no; and when he had ſatis fied himſelf that it was no dream, he was ſtill in ſome doubt whether he ſhould riſe from his knees, and go to ſalute him. Two paſſions he felt ſtrugling in him at the ſame point of time; the one tranſported him to the Father, with whom he already fancied himſelf; and the other held him where he was that he might make an end of his prayers to God. But finding at laſt that his ſpirits began to fail him, and that he knew not well what to add at preſent to his former Devotions; withall hoping that God had ſent his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector at this happy moment, to teach him to pray better; he went without any further deliberation, and threw himſelf into the arms of the Father, as ſoon as he ſaw that he was at leiſure to receive him.</p>
               <p>The good old man was as much ſurprized with the ſtrangeneſs of this accident as the <hi>Pilgrim</hi> could be. But when all other paſſions had ſpent themſelves which uſe to be moved on ſuch unexpected occaſions, they left Joy in the ſole poſſeſſion of his heart, which could not but ſtay there a great while, having ſo many cauſes to excite it. It was no ſmall pleaſure to ſee his ſon (as he could not but eſteem him) after ſo long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Friends never part with ſo much ſadneſs, but they meet again with as great a Joy. But then to meet
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:101895:159"/>him when he thought not of it, and to meet him in ſo good a place, and to find him ſo far advanced in his way to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and alſo to hear him ſo fervently deſire to be carried further; theſe things made his Joy exceed and boil up to a greater height. I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite what he ſaid unto him; and indeed it was not much; becauſe the young Pilgrim, though wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enlivened by the fight of the Father, yet could not ſo diſguiſe his ſoul, but that it left ſome deadneſs in his countenance. The Joyes and pleaſing Raptures into which he was caſt at this interview were not ſo bright, but that there remained ſome clouds upon his face which could not be diſpelled by them. This made the Good man very abruptly to break off his ſpeech as ſoon as he had entred into it; and it abated alſo a little of his ſatisfaction, when he ſaw by the paleneſs of his cheeks, and the dulneſs of his eyes, that all was not well with him.</p>
               <p>Yet there was no need to ask what he ailed, for he had no ſooner told the Father what Joy he conceived in his preſence, but he was ready to unboſome the grief of his heart to him; thinking to find ſome eaſe, both by diſcharging his ſoul into that breaſt, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it back again better informed in all its concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Many things he related to him; but above the reſt, I remember he inſiſted upon his preſent dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the loſs of thoſe Joyes that were wont to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him; which he had no means left to recover, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he was now ſent by God to reſtore them. And all the time of his ſpeech on this argument he lookt ſo ſorrowfully, that it would have moved an heart moſt void of compaſſion to behold him. His words like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe were all uttered with mournful accents, and not
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:101895:160"/>without the addition of ſome tears, though he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured as much as he could to reſtrain them, leſt they ſhould hinder all his mind from coming forth. Which when he had ſighed out with a great deal of paſſion; it was not poſſible ſo to repreſs them, but that all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in a plentiful ſhowre.</p>
               <p>At the end of which he being very ſilent, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thus addreſſed his ſpeech to him. And is this all you have to ſay againſt your ſelf? Then you may wipe your eyes, and look more chearfully, for you are not ſo ill as I ſee you imagine. You are more affraid than hurt; and unleſs you will be your own tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, there is nothing appears that can diſturb your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Did you not write me word that you received much ſatisfaction in this very caſe, by a Letter that I happily ſent unto you? Did not my Inſtructions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your ſetting out, bid you expect ſome cloudy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in your Travels? I thought you would have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtood by thoſe diſcourſes, that we muſt not expect alwayes the ſame joyes and conſolations in ſuch a varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of tempers as we now ſuffer; nor the ſame vigour and activity of ſpirit while we are ſo faſt chained to this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> as our preſent ſtate will have us. Did I not bid you alſo ſay perpetually, <hi>I am nought, I have nought, &amp;c.</hi> and did you not find this a moſt effectual ſpell to drive away all theſe black and diſmal thoughts? Why then did you think your ſelf worthy at all times to enjoy theſe pleaſures? Why did you not abaſe your ſelf at the feet of your Saviour, and confeſs to him that theſe are too great favours to be indulged conſtantly to us, on this ſide of our reſting-place? If there be any way to have them, it is this; not to expect them, and acknowledge that we do not deſerve them. Nay,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:101895:160"/>in thoſe ſubmiſſions and devolutions of our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Lord there is no ſmall ſatisfaction; unleſs it be no pleaſure to be united to his Will, which is inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably united to the higheſt pleaſures. You muſt give me leave to wonder a little that you ſhould be ſo forgetful. And I muſt tell you, it was very miſ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming your condition, to take it ill that you were not treated ever ſince I left you, according to your own deſires. Might it not have ſatisfied your mind to find your ſelf in the direct way to abiding and never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fading Joyes? Could you not have thought it Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs enough to look for perfect peace and repoſe at laſt in <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> Nay, might it not ſeem very reaſonable for a ſinner to ſubmit to ſo ſmall a puniſhment (if you will have it ſo termed) as to travel ſometimes in a rainy day? What arrogance is this, that we who have ſo oft offended, ſhould take offence if we be remembred of it? But that which ſeems more ſtrange to me than any thing elſe, is; that after you had reſigned your ſelf to your Saviours Will in this particular, you ſhould fall into the ſame trouble, if not fault again. You have tought me this by it, that I muſt expect to find my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients ſometimes afflicted with the ſame diſeaſe which I had cured, and perſecuted with the ſame ſcruples which they themſelves had ſatisfied. For elſe you that travelled thorow a ſandy and barren deſart once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, would not have been ſo dejected at the ſight of a new one; and when you could find no water in it, you would have refreſhed your thoughts as you were wont to do with the remembrance of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that I may never find you caſt upon your Bed by a relapſe into this ſickneſs any more, let me give you a larger account of theſe Joyes, the want of which hath
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:101895:161"/>been ſo grievous to you. I remember once that I met with a man that thought he wanted not above two or three ſteps of the Gate of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (though afterward I much queſtioned whether he knew any thing of the place) yea that imagined himſelf now and then to be caught up into Paradiſe. He was Angelical in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and more than Angelical in his own conceit; for he ſpoke of nothing but Extaſies and Raptures, and ſuch like things, that are by ſome men much exalted above the trifles (as they eſteem them) of Obedience. I endeavoured to learn of him what might be the ground of ſuch an high confidence of his nearneſs to God, and all that he was able to tell me amounted to no more but this, that he was ſo full of Joy, that his ſoul was ready to burſt its priſon, and eſcape to Heaven. Now, though you are not of this Enthuſiaſtical temper, yet perhaps you think there are no finer or more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable things than theſe Joyes for Heaven to beſtow upon you; judging of their worth, and the divineneſs of them by the delight wherewith they entertain you. But I muſt teach you another Leſſon, and inſtruct you to ſet a price upon them by another meaſure, and that is, <hi>The good they make you do.</hi> If theſe Joyes do not ſpur you to Obedience, and make you fruitful in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good work, they are not of ſuch value as you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine: and if in the abſence of them you mind your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and do the Will of God, it is as well, if not better; becauſe you do the ſame that you did before, only you have leſs encouragement to do it.</p>
               <p>Nay, more than this, I muſt let you know that theſe are things which God beſtows upon the moſt imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſouls, who are as yet not able to go, but only to creep in the way to Heaven. They are the ſweet Milk
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:101895:161"/>which he ſends us out of his breaſts when we are as yet but Babes, and in the infancy of Religion. He conſults our weakneſs in theſe gifts: and conſiders that as a child, while it wants teeth and ſtrength to feed it ſelf, muſt be nouriſhed with Milk; ſo the Soul, till it be able to underſtand the Goſpel, and feed upon the ſolid Truths thereof, muſt be entertained a while with this thinner dyet, which is moſt agreeable to its affectionate part. And withall he provides hereby that the heart which hath left the pleaſures of the world, may not be diſcouraged at the firſt entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his wayes for want of ſome other pleaſures: which it cannot well be without, becauſe it hath been ſo long uſed to them; and which it cannot yet find in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it ſelf, becauſe that is a thing of which it hath but a very childiſh underſtanding.</p>
               <p>And can you think now that God is not good to ſuch a perſon as you, who have been ſo long a ſervant to him? You ſee he is ſo far from letting grown ſouls be without comfort, that it is a thing he doth not deny to the moſt puling creatures, and thoſe who are but No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in the Spiritual Life. Or, Do you think that he loves thoſe beſt to whom he grants this kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation? I might as well imagine that the Gardner which I paſſed by the other day in my Travels, loved the young Plants beſt which brought him no profit, becauſe I obſerved him to water and fence, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prop thoſe tender things; whilſt he exerciſed no ſuch care about the well-grown Trees which uſed to load themſelves and him every year with their fruit. Alas! it is their weakneſs that requires this attendance upon them, and God powres theſe things upon imperfect ſouls, when others have none of them, not becauſe he loves them more, but becauſe they have more need. So
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:101895:162"/>you remember your Mother uſed to deal with your little Infant Siſter, to ſwaddle her, and dandle her, and kiſs her, and ſing to her, and find out a thouſand little toyes to pleaſe her; when you were left to dreſs your ſelf, and ſtudy better ſatisfactions, which yielded you the more pleaſure, becauſe you contributed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by your own labour to the finding of them. For the Love of God let us not accuſe him in this faſhion of unkindneſs, nor fancy that he frowns and ſcouls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, becauſe we have not thoſe ſmiles with which in our feeble age he was wont to look upon us and cheriſh us. You are paſt theſe things, and want nothing but this underſtanding, to make you a grown man in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>But conſider, I beſeech you, do you not feel him do far better things for you, than all the Joyes that ever you had amount unto? He feeds you, perhaps, with harder meat than Milk, but it gives you more nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and greater ſtrength; with more ſpirit and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity alſo, if heartily imbraced. Do you not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand more by a thouſand parts than formerly you did? Are you not able with greater conſtancy to beat off all Temptations of the fleſh and the world? Have you not your paſſions in a better command? And are not your Faith and Hope more rational things, ſo that you are able to render to any body an intelligent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them? Be contented then; for what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thing can God do for you, than to make you wiſe and holy as he himſelf is? No man would have reaſon to thank God more than you, if you would but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this among the reſt of the Truths which (bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be his Name) you are well acquainted withall; That it is no ſign God doth not love you, when you are not tranſported with ſenſible Joyes; and that your
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:101895:162"/>paſſions, which are otherwiſe quiet, ought not to be diſturbed for want of them. There is no cauſe, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, that they ſhould; for it will not be demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the laſt day, What comforts you have enjoyed; but rather what diſcomforts you have ſuffered without failing in your duty or ſlackning your Obedience.</p>
               <p>You have heard, I believe, very often the Story of the Prodigal Son, who having waſted all his Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in riotous courſes, yet returning to his Father, was received with ſuch joy, as was to the admiration of thoſe who knew not the reaſon of it. He cauſed him to be cloathed with the beſt Sute of Apparel that was in his Wardrobe; he made him a preſent of a Ring, to aſſure him of his affection; there was a great Feaſt prepared; there was nothing but muſick, and ſinging, and dancing to be heard; and we may very well think that He alſo gave him many imbraces now that he was at home, who had met him with ſo much paſſion when he was yet afar off. And yet at the ſame time he had another Son that was both elder and more dutiful; one that had never forſaken him, that had ſerved him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, that had never offended him in word or deed; for whom there was no ſuch chear provided. But, Would you have joyned with this elder Brother in his complaints (if you had been preſent at ſuch a meeting) becauſe he was not treated after this faſhion? Would you haue judged it very unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that a perſon of greater deſert ſhould have no ſuch Banquet made to entertain him? Or, would you have concluded that the Father had more love for this diſſolute youth, than for ſo ſtayd and ſober a man as he that alwayes obeyed him? It is poſſible you might have run into this miſtake, till you had heard the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:101895:163"/>ſay, <hi>My Son, thou art alwayes with me, and all that I have is thine;</hi> and then you would not have had a word to reply, unleſs it had been a great many thanks for the high eſteem that he had of him. You may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily apply all this to your ſelf, and conſidering that you are now grown up in the Love of God, and inriched with the knowledge of Chriſt, and poſſeſſed of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heavenly vertues; not expect to be careſſed in the ſame manner as the younger children are, nor repine for the want of that comfort, of which you are able by the Grace of God to provide your ſelf otherwayes. Your eyes are enlightened to know what is the hope of Chriſtianity, and what the riches of the Glory of that Inheritance is to which you are called. You ſee the title alſo that you have to thoſe great treaſures. You know what that mighty Power is which wrought in Chriſt when God raiſed him from the dead, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you are aſſured of the truth of all the Promiſes, and have a good foundation of your hope. You have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Witneſs of the Spirit, which was powred upon the Apoſtles and Prophets, and is the earneſt of the Inheritance. You have had the grace alſo to be obedient to God, which qualifies you for thoſe divine enjoyments. And therefore what cauſe is there for your diſcontents who are ſo fairly endowed? <hi>All things are yours:</hi> there is nothing that is good for you, but it is at your command (if I may ſpeak after our manner) even thoſe ſenſible comforts too, if by reaſon of any great diſtreſs you ſhould ſtand again in need of them. But ſince they are moſt proper to Beginners; and the entertainment of thoſe who enter upon the Spiritual Race; do not murmure that you are without them, ſince it is an argument of your proficiency in the Knowledge and Grace of our Lord, and you have
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:101895:163"/>greater benefits granted you, which if they be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will yield far more ſolid contentment.</p>
               <p>And that you may ſee what ſatisfaction lyes alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in your own breaſt, I beſeech you conſider what greater pleaſure can you be capable of, than to find your will ſubmitted to God, to overcome enemies, to wade thorow diſcouragements; unleſs it be this, to know that God is well pleaſed with you? And that is a thing which he will ſoon ſatisfie you in, if you can but ſatisfie your ſelf in the former: for <hi>the Lord loveth the righteous, and he taketh pleaſure in them that fear him, in them that hope in his mercy.</hi> Nay, I cannot but perſwade my ſelf that you believe, God is more pleaſed to ſee us obey him in the weakeſt manner, than meerly to ſee us full of conſolations, which the moſt ſenſual man in the world would be very glad to enjoy. And as for me, I take it alſo to be more acceptable to him, if againſt the deſires of ſenſuality and ſelf-will, and yet without theſe Joyes, we do what he commands; than if we did the ſame without any oppoſition, and when we have the Wind and Tyde of theſe pleaſures to help us forward. Tell me therefore why we our ſelves ſhould not be (at leaſt) as well pleaſed with what we do in a ſtate of ſadneſs and dulneſs of ſoul, ſince we are ſure ſuch works are not infected with any ſelf-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs, but performed out of clear and pure obedience to God. It is pitty that pious and ſincere-hearted men ſhould be tormented in this ſort that you now are: And therefore as I prayed you before for the Love of God, ſo I intreat you now for the love of your ſelf, that at leaſt you would reſt contented (if you cannot be well pleaſed) with any ſtate whereinto you ſhall fall, as long as therein you may do well, and cannot be hindred from obeying God as far as he requires.</p>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:101895:164"/>
               <p>And beſides this; Ought it not to pleaſe us that God will take any courſe to cure us of our diſeaſes? That which you think is a ſickneſs, may be but a means to prevent ſome worſe diſtemper, which he diſcerns, though you cannot, to be a growing. He ſees that one man will grow vain, and boaſt himſelf of theſe Joyes, not having an heart able to bear the weight of Divine Favours. Another he ſees will proceed to over-much confidence of his good eſtate by reaſon of theſe conſolations, and lay a greater weight upon them than they can bear. And as for a third, he ſees per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome little Pride peeping up in his ſoul, and that he is ready from hence to ſet an higher eſteem upon himſelf than other folks. Nay, there may be great danger leſt many ſouls ſhould totally putrifie if they were alwayes fed with theſe ſweets, and therefore he thinks it beſt to give them ſome myrrhe, by the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of which to preſerve them from corruption. They might be ſo greedy of theſe things, as to mind them more than their duty; and for that cauſe it is beſt to take them away, that they may be ſenſible there are other matters of greater moment and neceſſity. But if none of theſe dangers ſhould be ſuppoſed, will we not give God leave to exerciſe our Faith and Love, and make a tryal of the ſincerity and ſtrength of thoſe Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in what way he pleaſes? He would know per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance whether we will build our confidence upon himſelf, and upon his Promiſes, rather than on ſenſe; and whether we will follow after him upon the ſame account, though we have no preſent ſenſible at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive. And who can take it ill that he makes ſuch a proof of us, ſeeing we do it every day our ſelves to others; whoſe friendſhip we value not if they court us only when we are beſtowing gifts and benefits upon them?</p>
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:101895:164"/>
               <p>But if you think that this deprivation of Joy is a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for ſome fault which you have committed, and that it is a token he hath ſent you a bill of divorce and ſeparated you from him; you are much to blame in ſuffering your Soul to make ſuch a raſh concluſion. Perhaps you have deſerved to be chid for ſome fault, but will you preſently fancy that your Father intends to diſinherit you? Is it his manner to forſake and run away from us when we chance to ſtumble; and not rather to come and lift us up, and bid us take more heed to our ſelves? I never thought he loved us ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: and me thinks it ill comports with the notion of a <hi>Father,</hi> to repreſent him ſo ſevere. It is very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry indeed that you ſhould weigh your faults, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs them ſorrowfully, and mend them ſpeedily; but I can never think it is pleaſing to him that you ſhould be ſo diſmaid at them and afflicted for them, as to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine he will caſt you off and never look upon you more. No; I believe rather he eſteems this a greater diſ-ſervice to him, then the very fault it ſelf; becauſe it keeps us from mending what is amiſs, and makes us ſo feeble, that we are apt to offend in ſome kind or other again. To ſay nothing of the diſhonour it is to his Goodneſs, and the great ſcandal it gives to others, who will be loath to enter into the ſervice of that Maſter, whom they think it impoſſible to pleaſe. But then if under the pretence of humbling your ſelf, you ſhall make a ſin that is no bigger than a grain of Muſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, as great as an Elephant; I beſeech you what ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice do you therein do your Lord? And yet this ſtone many are apt to ſtumble at, and that ſo oft; that in time they fancy a great ſin there, where indeed one can find none at all.</p>
               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:101895:165"/>
               <p>Do you think our Saviour will conne you any thanks for aggravating your offences to this heigth, or accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing your ſelf when there is no guilt? Is there nothing for him to pardon unleſs you make ſome faults, or bring him a great mountain to cover and hide with his love? Let me tell you, my dear Brother, that this is a part of your miſtakes and a cauſe that you and Joy are no better acquainted. You imagine that you have done Nothing, and complain of ſuch dulneſs as if you had ſtood ſtill ever ſince I ſaw you; when as you have made a very fair progreſs, and in ſome things you ſee have overtaken my ſelf. And then on the contrary, you groan under the ſenſe of an heavy guilt; when as you did but neglect a Free-will offering, and was kept from a duty to which you had then no tye, but what you received from your own hands. You are apt I ſee to overwork your ſoul and to impoſe too great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens upon its back. Which when you are not ſo well able to bear, as ſometimes you find your ſelf; you are apt to think it a great fault if you take ſome eaſe: when as in truth it is your duty then to omit thoſe tasks you have injoyn'd your ſelf, that you may not neglect thoſe duties which are required by our Saviour. Come, come, my friend, if theſe things be all that trouble you, my life for yours, you ſhall do well enough. Let but my advice be followed, though at firſt it ſhould be with unwillingneſs; and take my word you ſhall fare the better for it in your after-courſe. And firſt I muſt not have you lay more loads upon your ſelf then Chriſt hath done; nor oblige your ſelf without the liberty of a diſpenſation to ſo many hours of Prayer and Reading every day. Let it ſuffice, to do what you can, all other things being duly conſidered that require your attendance.</p>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:101895:165"/>
               <p>Next, I muſt forbid you to make ſo much haſte to perfection. A ſoft pace goes far. Do not tire your ſpirits by your ſpeed, but go on ſo fairly and leiſurely, that you may hold out. And then likewiſe let me not hear any more that you exhauſt your natural ſtrength and weary your very body with much Faſting, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable abſtinence, long prayers, or ſuch like things, which had better be let alone, than procure ſo much miſchief as I have ſeen them do. And remember I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you that Leſſon, which I think was taught you before this journey, That you bind not your ſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to one way of Prayer or Meditation, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine your ſoul to one exerciſe only at the hours of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement; but chuſe that which ſhall like you beſt, and wherein you can proceed with the greateſt free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and delight. Beſides, I perceive you have forgot another of my Leſſons, which was to make uſe of ſome innocent Recreations and harmleſs paſtimes as you went along. And therefore what I did but then adviſe, let me now enjoyn, that you give your ſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a little divertiſement from more ſerious employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And truly if you ſhould ſay, as I know ſome do, that it is not for want of theſe Joyes that you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, but becauſe you can neither underſtand nor taſt the goodneſs of Divine truths; this laſt advice is one of the moſt uſeful that I can give you for the remedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that melancholly dulneſs. All that I ſhall add is only this, that you would have patience and you ſhall ſee the good temper wherein you were, return of it ſelf, as it went away without your conſent.</p>
               <p>Indeed ſaid the Pilgrim (who all this time had been very ſilent) I am very ſenſible that I have loſt a great many of your good counſels, or elſe I ſhould not have
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:101895:166"/>been ſo bad as here you find me. And I take it for a ſingular favour that <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath done me in ſending you again thither, to rub up my memory and to faſten thoſe things in my mind which hung there too looſe before. I muſt not forget likewiſe to acknowledge my new obligations to you, from whom I have now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not only ſo large, but ſo plain and familiar an anſwer to my doubt. And truly you do very prudently and charitably to lay your commands upon me to be more obſervant of your words hereafter; for if I ſhould not preſerve them, I ſee I am loſt my ſelf, and that in their ſafety is my ſecurity.—</p>
               <p>Here the good Father perceiving he had given him ſome ſatisfaction could not but interrupt his ſpeech, and being filled with pitty, and love and joy and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derment altogether, burſt out into theſe expreſſions of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now bleſſed be Jeſus who hath brought me to you ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely.</hi> O magnifie the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together. <hi>We can never admire thee enough O ſweet Jeſus, who art wont ſo ſeaſonably to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thy power to ſave us, when we have loſt our ſelves. Whither ſhould we ſtray, didſt not thou ſo gratiouſly ſeek us? What would become of us didſt not thou ſo lovingly hold us in thy hand, and reſolve that none ſhall pluck us from thee? We are aſtoniſht at the vaſtneſs of thy wiſdom. Thy Goodneſs is unfathomable, elſe we ſhould have ſunk long before this beyond the depth of it. When we wander, thou followeſt us and calleſt us back. When we fall, thou runneſt to us and lifteſt us up. When we are diſcouraged, thou art the strength of our fainting ſpirits and ſpeakeſt comfortably to our hearts. Tea by the rareneſs of thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:101895:166"/>arts thou turneſt our deepeſt ſorrows, into the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt occaſions of exceſſive joyes. And there where we thought to find nothing but trouble and heavineſs, thou makeſt gladneſs and light to ſpring up unto us. O how unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are thy wayes, who meeteſt us when we are out of the Way! O how unmeaſurable is thy Mercy, which cureth us by that which we love, even when we are doing that which thou dost not love! We cannot but preſent thee with the best of our acknowledgements, who are ſo happily together here, not by our own, but thy Providence. We cannot do leſs then bind our ſelves together to thine Altar, and offer all we have as a ſacrifice of Praiſe unto thee. And have us still, O Lord, in thy care. Let thy good Spirit alway go along with us as our Guide. And let thy good Angels never fail to be our Guardians.</hi> Uphold our goings in thy paths, and ſuffer not our feet any more to ſlide. Hold thou us up and we ſhall be ſafe: and we will have reſpect continually unto thy Statutes. <hi>So will we bleſs thy name at all times; thy praiſe ſhall be continually in our mouths. In the Courts of thine Houſe will we praiſe thee; yea, in the midſt of thee, O</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>will we ſing eternal praiſes.</hi> Hallelujah.</p>
               <p>I thank you moſt heartily, ſaid the Pilgrim (when the other had ended this acknowledgment) for theſe good thoughts you have breathed into me. I feel my ſelf as if a new Soul did informe me: and my Spirit doth not ſo much return, as another more divine ſeems to enter into me and invigorate all my faculties with an higher degree of ſtrength and courage. Sure, if you would be alwayes with me, I ſhould never miſcarry, no nor grow dull and lumpiſh any more. May I not beg that favour of you to take me under your wings? Is it too great an happineſs for me to ask, that you would
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:101895:167"/>become ſo much my Friend, as to take a particular care of me, and let me travel in your company? I can never expect ſo much ſecurity and ſo much comfort both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as under your conduct; and therefore if I ſhall not be too great a burden, carry me along, I beſeech you, with you, and let me never be left, as I was, alone without your ſociety. You were pleaſed to compare me to another <hi>Hercules</hi> becauſe of ſome reſolution which you diſcerned in me. But let me tell you Sir, that together with the joy you have made to return, I have recovered alſo the memory of ſo much of the ſmall learning of my younger dayes, as to know that while <hi>Hercules</hi> was cutting off the heads of <hi>Hydra,</hi> there was one <hi>Iolaus</hi> ready at hand to apply fire to them, to hinder their ſpringing up again. It ſeems this great perſon was not ſtrong enough without one to back him. He durſt not travel through the World, unleſs he took a companion with him. I never heard of any Worthy that had not ſome Genius or other to aſſiſt him, and the ſociety alſo of ſome friend to ſecond his undertakings. Do not expect then from me that I ſhould be more then a Miracle. Do not blame me that I cannot be ſo hardy, as to travel any further alone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Though I ſhould call for all the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and aids that my courage can give me, yet I muſt be beholden to the help of ſome aſſociate in my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. And O that it might be my lot to fall into your company, or cuſtody rather; for I ſhall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge you for a kind of Tutelar Angel, a good familiar ſpirit; and receive you as the richeſt preſent that Heaven could have made me. I do not beg you ſee a friendſhip of you that ſhall ſerve only to paſs away the time, and deceive the tediouſneſs of being alone; but ſuch an one as with the pleaſure will bring me in an
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:101895:167"/>ineſtimable gain. Do not deny me therefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that pleaſure which I hope will not diſpleaſe your ſelf; or that profit, which will do you no hurt. Make me rich, ſince you will not thereby become the poorer. Impart an happineſs to me, which will not abate any thing of your own repoſe. And truly Sir, I do not know whether Heaven have not deſigned you for that end; and given you a frame of nature ſo fit for conjunction with mine, that both together will make one perfect man. You ſee how earneſt and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent I am; and I am very ſenſible of your great ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and diſcretion. Now I have ſomewhere read that a friendſhip between two perſons thus diſpoſed, is like the Marriage of Iron and Steel, where the one gives toughneſs, and the other edge. Let us joyn then our hands and our hearts together, if you do not think me unworthy of ſuch an honour. Let this be our Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-day: and from henceforth take me for your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable Companion.</p>
               <p>To this unexpected ſuit, the good Father made a reply to this effect. Though it be a great thing which you require, yet I would have you think that Love eſteems it a very ſmall matter to give. I have called you often, <hi>My Friend,</hi> already; and ſince you will have it more than a term of civility or common affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I ought not to be leſs forward than your ſelf to advance it unto a more noble ſignification. I have no cauſe at all to ſuſpect you of the vanity of Courtſhip and Complement; and therefore I will be ſo preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous as to believe you have conceived for me an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſo high as that you expreſs, provided you will alſo acknowledge the great paſſion which I have for your ſervice. It ſeems ſo ſtrong an obligation upon me,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:101895:168"/>for a perſon of your deſert to think of giving me his heart, that I cannot think it Juſtice to keep mine any longer, but only under the notion of another mans goods. There are many perſons, I confeſs, to whom I am bound by other obligations to give my advice, and the welfare of whoſe ſouls I am to attend; which might make me unwilling to hearken to this deſire of yours, and engage my ſelf in ſo weighty a charge. But ſince I diſcern a more than ordinary Love in your breaſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, and ſince I am touched with a reciprocal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and (which is more) do feel a certain incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation towards you above all others; I cannot contain my ſelf, but I muſt agree to your motion. It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, we are engaged to love all men, and our Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ought to be as diffuſive as the Sun-beams; but yet I am of the mind that ſome may challenge a more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar portion of it than other of their neighbours. For I obſerve that the Sun it ſelf is more fond of ſome plants than it is of the reſt; ſo that we ſee one of his Favourites turns its face about according to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it may not miſs of his ſalutes; and another, they ſay, which lifts up its head above water when he ariſes, is wont to ſink down again at his ſetting; as if it would then hide it ſelf, and ſecretly bewail his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. I call to remembrance alſo that God himſelf had his <hi>Peculiar People;</hi> and that even among them, there were ſome choſen perſons to whom he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated more of his ſecrets. When his own Son appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to men with the greateſt kindneſs toward them, yet then I ſee he had ſome ſelect ſouls who were nearer to him than any other. And beſides the <hi>Seventy Two</hi> Diſciples who were particularly devoted to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; he made choice of <hi>Twelve Men</hi> to be intruſted more immediately with all the Myſteries of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:101895:168"/>And me-thinks theſe <hi>Twelve</hi> did not equall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſtand in his favour, but there was ſome difference which he made in his eſteem of them. For I obſerve that there were <hi>Three</hi> who were cull'd out to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his Glory, and before whom he was transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured on the Holy Mount, when all the reſt were left with the multitude below. Nay, and of theſe <hi>Three</hi> there was <hi>One</hi> called the Beloved Diſciple, and became his more boſome friend than either of the other two. And therefore ſince the Saviour of the World, that great Mirror of all Vertues, had his inclinations and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular friendſhips; I will not fear to follow ſo great a precedent. After an example of ſuch high Authority, I doubt not to contract a nearer and ſtricter Amity with one than all the reſt of my acquaintance. And ſince the ſame Saviour will have you to be my corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent in ſo dear a Love (as I gueſs both by his ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now ſo ſeaſonably for your relief, and alſo by the ſudden change which your very language tells me my diſcourſe hath wrought in your ſoul) I ſhall gladly receive you with the greateſt paſſion into my imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and hereafter become your perpetual Companion, as well as your Director and Guide.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Neceſſity of Friendſhip. Of faithful Counſel. How the Pilgrim doubted whether there was ſuch a place as <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The ſatisfaction which his Friend gave him in this particular. As alſo the comfort he admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to him in a great Sickneſs.</head>
               <p>NOw the poor mans heart was filled with an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible Joy, and he could ſcarce travel for a while by reaſon of this paſſion which was as trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to him, as the contrary had been before. But having at laſt overcome the exceſs of it, and diſſembled it alſo while it ſtayd as well as he could, leſt his Friend ſhould think he was made up of nothing but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and inconſtancy; On they went very merrily, ſinging ſeveral Hymns which they had learnt, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers miles together. When they were ended; they fell into a very pleaſant diſcourſe about heavenly Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And the good Father did highly extol thoſe Divine Souls, who had converted the <hi>Muſes,</hi> and of Courteſans and leud Strumpets made them turn Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and Saintly Creatures. Surely, ſaid he, it was a brave and noble Act to reclaim them from ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched life as they had a long time lead. It was a piece of very eminent ſervice to the world, to reform their impure ſpeech, and teach them the language of Angels. If there were a greater number of ſuch inſpired minds, one would think they ſhould convert the whole World, by pleaſing and inſtructing it both together.</p>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:101895:169"/>
               <p>After he had proceeded for ſome time in this ſtrain, the young <hi>Pilgrim</hi> took occaſion from thence to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Harmony that is between ſome ſouls, and the ſweet conſent of two equal and well-proportion'd hearts, which he thought were able to interchange the greateſt felicities in the World. I have heard indeed, ſaid he, that it was the opinion of ſome of the ancient Sages, that a wiſe man ſtands in need of no body but himſelf, and that whatſoever is without him, is not at all needful to him. But ſure theſe were peeviſh and moroſe people, whom I cannot but condemn as guilty of one of the moſt dangerous Schiſms in the world. He was far wiſer, I think, that ſaid; <hi>If we look on men in general, they do not ſeem ſo much a great many ſeveral intire bodyes, as ſo many divided parts which Society re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unites:</hi> I muſt needs confeſs, for my own part, that I feel my ſelf but half a man without a friend. I cannot but place him in the number of neceſſary, and not only of delightful things. It is the prerogative of God to need none but himſelf. It is too much for us to live alone, who incloſe ſo ſmall a portion of wiſdom and ſtrength within our Beings. I do not reckon my ſelf ſafe without your company. My felicity would be imperfect if you did not compleat it. I dare not ſo much as truſt my own thoughts unleſs you approve them; nor follow my own counſels unleſs you allow them.</p>
               <p>And here he began to ſpeak of the neceſſity of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful counſel, and that it was not to be procured without a friend. For though we love our ſelves never ſo well, yet a friend will be leſs treacherous to us, than we ſhall be to our ſelves. This brought to mind a Comment which was made by a wiſer man than any of thoſe
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:101895:170"/>ſullen pieces of gravity before-named, upon that old obſcure ſaying; <hi>Dry light is ever the beſt.</hi> Certain it is, ſaith he, That the Light which a man receives by counſel from another faithful perſon, is dryer and purer than that which cometh from his own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and judgment. For as that which he receives is ſeparate from all intereſt, ſo that which he gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is commonly infuſed and drenched in his Cuſtoms and Affections. So that there is as much difference between the counſel of a friend, and that which a man beſtows on himſelf, as between the counſel of a friend and of a flatterer. For there is no ſuch flatterer as in a mans ſelf; and there is no ſuch remedy againſt the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of a mans ſelf, as the liberty of a friend. And, as one thing uſually draws on another, this brought to his thoughts a handſome diſcourſe of another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom he had met withall, which very well illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated the reaſon of it; and was to this effect. Every man, we ſay, is neareſt to himſelf; but yet he is too near to be his own Counſellor in things which concern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. There is not ſpace enough between both, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to debate the counſel which is given, and which is received. He cannot hinder thoſe two Reaſons which deliberate in him from confounding themſelves in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication; for that which propoſeth is too much mixt with that which concludes. He can find no place free wherein to weigh his Reaſons. But he propoſes thoſe which will favour his own humour, and then he inclines unto them, becauſe they are his own. He who counſels therefore muſt be another perſon diſtinct from him who is counſelled. The objects muſt be ſet at a proportionable diſtance from thoſe facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which judge of them. And as the moſt quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted can never ſee themſelves; ſo the greateſt
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:101895:170"/>wits want perſpicacity in things that reſpect their own intereſt.</p>
               <p>In ſuch delightful and uſeful talk as this they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled the time, and ſhortned the length of the wayes. And it was no ſmall contentment, you may well think, to the good old man, that he was poſſeſſed of ſuch a friend who could refreſh him with his apt diſcourſes, and give as well as receive inſtruction. But though the young Pilgrim was a perſon of ſuch competent abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and had ſo good a friend as this to aſſiſt him, imagining alſo when the firſt contract was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, that he ſhould now be no more diſturbed; yet he was not without ſome melancholy thoughts at certain ſeaſons, of which this, as I remember, was the chief. They two being talking one day about the Pleaſures of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the great happineſs they ſhould enjoy at their arrival there, which ought to ſweeten by its expectation all the difficulties of the way; he askt his companion with a very ſad and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding countenance, if it might not admit of ſome diſpute whether there was ſuch a place or no, and how he would prove the exiſtence of it.</p>
               <p>At which Queſtion, becauſe he ſeemed to make a real doubt, the Father gave a very great ſtart, and ſaid with a more than ordinary vehemence: What? Are we now to begin again, and do you remain unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of that which was the firſt thing you learnt? What was it that made you ſtir one foot in this Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, if you were not perſwaded you ſhould come to <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> Or how came you to hold out thus long, and that you did not tyre many months ago? And did you not once, when you were tempted by ſome
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:101895:171"/>idle perſons to diſbelieve it, reject with anger all their frivolous allegations? Good God! What a thing is the Soul of man? How weak and infirm is our nature? How fickle and uncertain are our moſt ſerious thoughts? And what a great patience is it that we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe every day? Surely if thy Love were not wider than the Circle of Heaven, we ſhould throw our ſelves out of the compaſs of it.— Say no more, ſaid the other (who here interrupted his ſpeech) for I am very ſenſible of the truth of what you affirm. The Soul of man is an object very worthy of your pitty, and whoſe ſtate can never be ſufficiently deplored. Nor do I know any Soul that deſerves it more than mine, which is made, it ſeems, to exerciſe your patience as well as God's. We cannot help it, I think (ſo ſhort and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are our Thoughts) but we muſt go backward and forward. Sometimes we are confident, and ſometimes we are doubtful. Now we are merry, and preſently we are ſad even becauſe we were merry. Nothing will ſhake us in this temper, but in another a leaf or a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will make us turn aſide. But do not, I beſeech you, upbraid unto me this miſery; which rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores your charity to find a cure for it.</p>
               <p>Well then, ſaid the other, in compliance with your neceſſity, let us ſtep back a little (which I hope will not prove a very great hinderance to us) and let us ſearch if we have fooliſhly undertaken this Journey to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> So he led him by the hand to a certain friend's houſe which they had not left much behind, and there (without accepting of any refection which was offered to them) preſently called for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Book which was full of Mapps attended with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of ſeveral Countries: in one of which was a
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:101895:171"/>deſcription of the promiſed land and the famous City <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And that he might be aſſured of the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, he bad him caſt his eye to the bottom, and there he ſhould find the name of the man that was the Author of thoſe fair Tables: and who ſhould that be, but <hi>Jeſus,</hi> together with a ſervant of his St. <hi>Paul</hi> who finiſhed by his direction what his Maſter had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun. There he found that the former of theſe perſons profeſſed that he came from Heaven, which he proved alſo by many Arguments of Divine Authority: and the latter that he was caught up into Paradiſe and the third Heavens, where he had a perception of ſuch things as could not be painted in thoſe Papers. And then turning over ſeveral leaves that treated of this Country; he ſhewed him ſuch an exact Deſcription of the Situation and Nature of the place, of the Quality of the Inhabitants, of the imployments wherein they are ingaged, of the Fruits of the Soil, of the Way that led to it, of the Travels of ſeveral perſons that had gone thither, of the return of one of them (even <hi>Jeſus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) upon ſeveral occaſions into this World, and of the deſcent of Angels which aſſured men of it, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the teſtimony of many undeniable Witneſſes (all ſervants of Jeſus) concerning the truth of theſe things, whom he alſo there examined over again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; that he was aſhamed of his incredulity and bluſht to think that he had given him this new trouble. But above all, the Good man ſhow'd him that <hi>Jeſus</hi> by his laſt Will and Teſtament had made over an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to all his faithful Followers. And that he had ſealed and ratified this Will with his own deareſt blood. And that God had ſet to it his Seal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, by raiſing him from the dead and giving him Glory at his own right hand. And that this was demonſtrated
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:101895:172"/>and that Deed of Chriſt further eſtabliſhed, by the ſending of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Apoſtles and thoſe to whom they Preached. For this made it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſaid he, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is Crowned King in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from whence he ſent theſe Royal gifts to men, and it is the <hi>earneſt of our inheritance; and by it we are ſealed to the day of Redemption.</hi> All which and much more for his further ſatisfaction and better remembrance he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward got one to compriſe in a little Book; wherein was ſhown that <hi>This is the record which God hath given of his Son, that in him we have eternal life.</hi> It would make my relation too long if I ſhould tranſcribe that Treatiſe, which is alſo come to my hands; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall only acquaint you with the concluſion of their diſcourſe on this argument, which was to this purpoſe. And now, ſaid the Father, if you call in queſtion the credit of this Story concerning <hi>Jeſus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you never ſaw him; I would wiſh you to take heed leſt you be a teacher of Rebellion and learn men to juſtifie Sedition againſt their lawful Soveraign. For if we muſt entertain nothing but what we our ſelves ſee; then the Rabble may do well to ſay; they have no King becauſe they never ſaw his face; nor hath he yet gone his Progreſs among them: and that there are no Laws that oblige them, becauſe they were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent when they were enacted, nor heard his Majeſty ſay, <hi>The King Will,</hi> or that he conſented to them. For my part I cannot ſee leſs reaſon to believe, that our Lord was miraculouſly conceived, uſhered into the World by a Star and the ſhouts of the Heavenly hoſts, annointed with the Holy Ghoſt at his Baptiſm, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured on the holy Mount, confeſſed by Devils, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by Angels, juſtified by Miracles, raiſed from the Dead, and taken up to Glory; then our
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:101895:172"/>children will have to believe that our preſent Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign after a long baniſhment was ſuddenly reſtored to his Throne, that he entred his Royal City on ſuch a day with the joyful acclamations of all his people; that he rode in Triumph and was ſolemnly Crowned the year following; and that the Book containing a deſcription of the Magnificent Ceremonies of that day, gives a true and juſt account of them. They that would perſwade you to doubt of the truth of the holy Writings which conveigh the notice of thoſe great things to you, and whereby you hold all the hopes you have of happineſs at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> may in time think their wits ſo fine as to go about to prove that the <hi>Great Charter</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is but a forged Deed, that all the Liberties you think you have are but the Idols of your own brain, or that the whole Writing by factious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits hath been corrupted and altered at their pleaſure. And if you ſhould ſay, that there are ſo many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſtop their mouths that they will be aſhamed of ſuch fooliſh talk; for Kings have ſealed it, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments confirm'd it, and all Engliſh men have a long time aſſerted it; you will find your ſelf much miſtaken and ſee that theſe allegations are not conſiderable with ſuch diſputes. For ſo have theſe holy books (as I eſteem them) been ever received for the Apoſtolical Writings; none could ever prove them guilty of any impoſture; nor do their greateſt enemies charge them with the crime of reporting falſe Miracles; yea the Jews acknowledge them to have been wrought, and Heathen writers have ſet their hands to ſome things of no mean account; and yet theſe are not ſufficient with ſuch men to prove them true becauſe they did not ſtand at the Apoſtles elbows when they were pen'd and ſent abroad into the World. And therefore what
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:101895:173"/>is the confeſſion of all <hi>England</hi> worth to prove your Liberties; ſince the confeſſion of the whole Chriſtian World for ſo many ages is not worth a ſtraw with them to prove theſe Writings? If they will not let you have a <hi>Jeſus</hi> becauſe they did not ſee him; why ſhould they ſuffer you to enjoy any other things which they can take away upon the ſame pretence? But if they will permit you to enjoy the benefit of any antient Deeds, when nothing can be juſtly excepted againſt them; then we hope that it is lawful to call the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel (as one of the Antients doth) <hi>our new Conveyance</hi> whereby Jeſus hath ſetled upon us an everlaſting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in the Heavenly Country, of far greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue then that which the Iſraelites by Vertue of the old writings poſſeſſed in the earthly.</p>
               <p>Here the young Traveller pluckt him by the ſleeve beſeeching him to make no longer ſtay in that place, for, ſaid he, you have diſſipated all my clouds already and I am fully perſwaded that there is ſuch a City as <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Though I doubted a little of it, yet let me not be ſuſpected of Infidelity. I proteſt to you that I bear ſuch a reverend regard to theſe Writings which you have laid before me, that I would rather loſe all the goods I have in the World then part with them. I have a long time held them ſo Sacred that they have been my comforters in all my troubles, and the ſongs of my Pilgrimage. At this very moment I carry them about me and ſhall hereafter ſet a greater value on them; for what I have held by Cuſtome I ſhall now hold by Reaſon, and be able to render an account to thoſe that aſk of the Hope that is in me. Let us go on Sir I intreat you without any further diſpute, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever negligent I have been in former times I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:101895:173"/>hereafter to read this Holy Book with more attention of Mind: and to procure thereby that this ſhort ſtay may not make me come a whit the later to my journeys end.</p>
               <p>It is very well done, ſaid the Father, that you have provided your ſelf with ſo neceſſary a companion as that Book is: which might ſerve to direct you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me, but that I ſee you are not ſufficiently acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the language of it. When you read of the <hi>Witneſs of the Spirit,</hi> its like you waited for ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate aſſurance of the truth of theſe writings. And when you heard them ſpeak of our being <hi>ſealed with the holy Spirit of promiſe,</hi> you lookt for an inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and expected to be ſtampt and impreſſed with a certain perſwaſion of their Authority. Which is as much as to ſay, that you deſired to be endued with a confidence, which as it ſtood upon no ground, ſo might be ſhaken without any cauſe at all. But I pray you hereafter to be as good as your word, applying your mind more vigorouſly to comprehend the ſenſe of what you read; and where you doubt of any thing, repair to me, that I may aſſiſt your Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. And above all things let me once for all adviſe you to uſe all means to ſtrengthen your faith concerning the other Life, and to aſſure your ſelf upon ſuch evidence as I have given you, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is gone to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and there expects your coming to him. Do but firmly perſwade your heart of this, and keep it in your mind, and then I ſhall think it as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for you to grow weary, as for the Sun to ſtand ſtill; and as impoſſible you ſhould miſcarry, as that the Sun ſhould fall from his Orb.</p>
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:101895:174"/>
               <p>After he had received a promiſe from him, that he would do his endeavour to make his Soul more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this weighty thing: they buckled themſelves afreſh to their march. And never did the young man travel ſo luſtily as now; for he had gathered much ſtrength by his doubting; and thought he felt himſelf attracted and haled towards Heaven by the glory of it which now ſhone upon him; juſt as the Loadſtone draws Iron to it, and makes it skip into its Boſome. If I ſhould ſay that he ran now rather then went, I ſhould miſreport the fervours wherein he felt himſelf; which indeed furniſhed him with Wings, and made him not ſo much to run, as fly towards the Holy City of God. He was all aiery, and ſeemed not to touch the Earth with his feet: and as for his own Fleſh, he had ſo many Spirits, that it was no more a Burden to him then the Feathers are to a Bird, which rather help then hinder it in its flight. But yet (ſo mutable is this Body of ours) he had not flown very long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſiſted by every thing that he ſaw, or heard, or met withal, before he was made ſenſible that he was cloathed with a greater weight of Fleſh then he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined; and that this Globe Earth had a greater pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over him then he was willing to believe. For he was ſeized with ſuch a violent ſickneſs, and felt his blood in ſuch a boiling heat; that he thought now he was not in the Air, but at the beſt in a thick cloud of ſtinking vapours which almoſt choaked his Vital ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. He had not mounted up to ſo high a pitch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but he fancied now that he was ſunk as low; and that the Terreſtrial parts prevailed, if not far more, yet as much as the Aerial had lately done. Very often he laboured to heave up himſelf; and left no means unattempted to ſoar aloft as he was wont;
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:101895:174"/>but all in vain, for he was ſo oppreſſed and over-load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that ſluggiſh matter which now flowed through his whole Body, that he could ſcarce fetch his breath, unleſs it were in ſighs and groans at the alteration which he ſuffered. Juſt as a veſſel of good Wine which now being ſweet and pleaſant, is rendred ere long acid and ungrateful to our palate, by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and flowing of thoſe ſaline particles which before were thruſt down or put aſide: So was his Spirit ſowred and rendred unacceptable to himſelf, by the floating again of thoſe ill humours, which he hoped had been buried in their graves, never to riſe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb him any more.</p>
               <p>It would be both too tedious and too ſad, to relate all the affliction which he endured from his dejected thoughts; And I ſhall rather chuſe to tell you how his companion addreſſed himſelf to his Cure, whereby you will underſtand ſufficiently the nature of his diſeaſe. I am ſorry to ſee you thus ill (ſaid his kind Phyſitian when he firſt came to him) but it is no more then I expected; and it would not much trouble me, if I did not find your mind more diſordered then your body. I will not add ſo much to your pain, as to bid you tell me what it is that troubles you; for I am not ſo unacquainted with theſe diſtempers, but that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſymptomes of a mind much grieved, becauſe it cannot think of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with the ſame freedome and pleaſure, that it did not long ago. This I eaſily ſee is the ſickneſs you labour under; and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide the anguiſh which this creates, I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you have any reaſon to complain. But I pray you, my Dear Brother, do you not think of our Lord very much, when you are Patient and quietly reſigned
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:101895:175"/>to his Will in every thing? Are you not much in his company when you take up your Croſs with a meek Spirit, ſaying, Not my will, but thine be done? For what was <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but a great Example of Patience and humble ſubmiſſion to the pleaſure of God through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole courſe of his Life? Why do you then place the contentment of your heart in being able to pray with your wonted intention, and to contemplate Divine things with ſuch a clearneſs as when you were in the pure ſky; and not rather in accompliſhing the Will of our Lord, who knows what place is beſt for us and what condition will moſt certainly conduce to our Good? Let me ask you; is not this ſickneſs now come upon you by his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſent by the direction of his wiſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? Do you not think it to be his will, that the time which not long ago was ſpent in praying, ſhould now be ſpent in vomiting? Let it be ſo then (as a good man was wont to ſay) and let us not mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at it: but ſee you take more pleaſure in this that he is pleaſed, then if you poſſeſſed Heaven and Earth. And ſuppoſe this be a puniſhment for ſome offence, and that now he chaſtiſes ſome inordinate deſire; for I diſcern, me thinks, an indication of ſome ſuch ſcruple that moleſts your thoughts: what have you more to do in that caſe but to be thankful, and to caſt your ſelf at his feet, deſiring both correction and forgiveneſs. To be thankful I ſay, becauſe we are much beholden to him, that he will put himſelf to the trouble of finding out means of our amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nay, ſome pious men have thought, that to be corrected by the hand of ſuch a Father, and with ſo much love, doth put us rather into a need of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility for the moderating our joy which we ſhall
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:101895:175"/>be apt to conceive in his Charity towards us; than of the Vertue of Patience whereby to endure the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he layes upon us. For is it not a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that he will look after us? Is it not a mark of his eſteem that he thinks it worth his pains to uſe his Rod to reclaim us? And would you have him be ſo fond as to let you proceed to commit thoſe faults, which he knows will utterly ſpoil you? Should he love you if he did forbear his ſtripes, when he ſees there is great need of ſuch ſharp inſtruments to reform you? Or do you think he delights to afflict, and takes a greater pleaſure to hear you cry and roar under his hand, than to hear you ſing and rejoyce in his arms? It is unchriſtian to impute unto him ſuch Cruelty. You cannot without impiety imagine, either that he will not chaſtiſe his children in order to make them ceaſe to offend; or that he will not grant a pardon when they humbly bow their wills to his, and ask it of him. No queſtion he will do both when cauſe requires; and though ſometimes he gives a pardon without any correction, yet never the correction without an intent to pardon. Lye ſtill therefore under his Fatherly hand, and then I aſſure you there is greater reaſon both to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and alſo to expect a pardon; becauſe you are much amended when your own will is ſo broken, that you can ſubmit to any of his Rods.</p>
               <p>But here I muſt not forget to admoniſh you of one thing, which I have ſomewhere read in the advices of a grave Perſon, which is; To take great heed that your fleſh do not deceive and cheat you with its diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulations while you are in this ſtate; endeavouring to ſlubber over negligence under the pretext of, <hi>I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do any more.</hi> It is true, we are not tyed to that
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:101895:176"/>which we cannot do; but yet the fleſh will ſometimes juggle and complain of impotence, when there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinders us but only Sloth. Here you muſt look upon your ſelf with a great many eyes; you muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your own ſpy, and narrowly watch the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret motions of your heart. For this <hi>Eve</hi> that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, is ſo deſirous to be cheriſhed and pleaſed, to be walking up and down the Garden, and to be eating of the forbidden fruit; that ſhe wants not a thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions to make us believe that her demands do not extend to ſuperfluities, but only to things neceſſary for us; that ſhe doth not deſire eaſe and pleaſure ſo much as reſt from hard labours; and ſhe is in a mighty chafe if we will not give a perfect credit to her. She per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades us ſometime that we are much weaker than in truth we can affirm our ſelves to be: She tells us that we cannot with ſafety think of any thing elſe but her, and is not willing to let us make a tryal: She bids us attend only to her quiet and ſatisfaction, and not ſuffer the mind to diſturb her repoſe at all: And the more we humour and gratifie her deſires, the more ſtill ſhe bemoans her ſelf to move our pitty towards her. It concerns us therefore to be careful in obſerving what good it is that we can then perform without a manifeſt prejudice to our health, and to make proviſion that it be not neglected by means of the heavy complaints of lazineſs and ſloth. Look up unto <hi>Jeſus</hi> as often as you can. Tell him in the ſecrets of your ſoul that you hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily love him. Open your very boſome to him, and ſhew how deſirous you are to be more conform'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by this affliction. Pray him to come and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack your heart, and to throw out of doors, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is offenſive to him. Let him know that you had rather (not only be ſick, but) dye a thouſand times
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:101895:176"/>than not be friends with him. And ſo entreat him to take pitty upon you. Promiſe him to do whatſoever he would have you. And exhort all others of your acquaintance, that they would love and ſerve him more than you can do. And this let me add for your comfort, that ſometimes he beſtows more favours up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſick men in their Beds, who can pray in no other manner, but by the humiliations and proſtrate ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of their Wills to him; than he doth upon ſome others who ſpend many hours on their bended knees in that holy exerciſe. And do not deſpair, I beſeech you, of receiving this mercy, though you think your ſelf never ſo unworthy of it, ſince it coſts him no more, but only his Will to beſtow it.</p>
               <p>With theſe, and ſuch like Diſcourſes, the Good man entertained his friend in this ſickneſs for many dayes; which put the time into a ſpeedier pace than otherwiſe it would have paſſ'd away. Though he kept his Bed for ſome weeks, yet the hours did not ſeem at all tedious to him, but rather fled away as faſt, as he uſed before to do himſelf. So happy a thing it is to have a partner in our troubles, and the aſſiſtance of another ſhoulder beſide our own to bear our griefs. Good Diſcourſes are like the breath of Heaven, which when the burdned Veſſel feels, ſhe cuts her way through all the waves, and never complains of the greatneſs of her burden. Nay, they proved to him like the cool Air which refreſhes the gaſping Traveller in a hot day; making his very body feel its leggs the ſooner, by the delicate touches which they gave unto his Spirit. All the Art of his Doctors, and an whole Apothecaries ſhop had not been able to reſtore his conſumed fleſh ſo eaſily, and in ſuch a little ſpace of time; as theſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:101895:177"/>Cordials which diſtilled from the Good mans lips, and were drawn, he felt, from the very bottome of his heart. I have wondred ſometimes when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the ſuddenneſs of his recovery; for though he lay ſome weeks in a feeble condition, it was becauſe he did not at firſt receive theſe Medicines; which ſo ſoon as he taſted, he became another man, and ſeemed to have a New Eſſence infuſed into him. It is no new piece of Philoſophy, but an Axiome older than <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> and which calls <hi>Solomon</hi> (that great Phyſician) its Father; <hi>Heavineſs in the heart of man maketh it ſtoop:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 12.25</note>

               <head type="sub">Of the trouble which the Pilgrim was in about ſome buſineſs which had layn neglected during his ſickneſs. Of his deſires after a contemplative Life. Of Solitude. The Profit of it: eſpecially at the beginning of our Chriſtian courſe. And how they that enjoy it, do not find all the ſatisfaction which they expected in it.</head>
               <p>BEing able therefore by the good inſpirations of his friend (whoſe mouth he acknowledged was a <hi>Well of Life</hi>) to go about the houſe;<note place="margin">Pro. 10.11</note> He ſpent as much time as he was able in praiſing God, inſtructing the ſervants, and doing good to all his neighbours, not neglecting any duty which God or man required of him. But ſo it was, that having been long ſick, there were ſome neceſſary buſineſſes in which both he and his friend
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:101895:177"/>were concerned, that had layn as long as himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard. Theſe called very importunately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him for his attendance, and being very weighty, and requiring quick diſpatch, would not ceaſe to ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite more of his thoughts than he was willing to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them. It will be of no uſe to tell you what they were, but it may be ſufficient to let you know that they were of ſuch moment that without a manifeſt wrong both to himſelf and others, he could by no means put them off, nor make them reſt contented with a cold and ſlow management of them. And yet from hence his mind took occaſion to ſpring a new doubt, which he had not power to remove himſelf, till he had made it known to his Friend; though his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs were not ſo urgent but that they left him a little leiſure to conſider of that which might have given him ſome ſatisfaction. For whenſoever a crowd of little occaſions throng'd in upon him and would not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed his company; then he began to frown upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf becauſe he did not find ſo much vacancy as his heart deſired for private Prayer and Recollection.</p>
               <p>To this the Father ſaid (as ſoon as he had eaſed himſelf of the ſcruple by telling of it) that for his part he was very glad to find he had ſuch a vehement love for retired thoughts and ſecret converſe with God; and that he ſighed ſo much after it, as far more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to him then the open World and all the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very which it hangs out to us. But he told him alſo that he was to be blamed for thinking himſelf leſs pleaſing to God in what he was a doing, becauſe he was leſs pleaſing to himſelf. For, do you not know, ſaid he, that God hath bidden us ſerve our neighbour as much as we can? and that it is an idle pretence to ſay
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:101895:178"/>we love God whom we never ſaw, if we love not our Brother whom we ſee continually? And hath he not placed us in a Body which muſt be fed, and that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be nouriſhed with Thoughts and live upon Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; nor be ſupported without the labour of its own hands? Why then do you complain that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be filled with a Prayer, and have its hunger ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with an Hymn? Perhaps it may ſo fall out, that a great many things ſhall require our ſervice at one and the ſame time; and though we call not for them all together, yet they call on us and bid us mind them; or elſe they ſay that they will be gone and not wait upon our leiſure. Is there any reaſon now to turn thoſe things away that will not come again? or ſhall we trouble our ſelves that we have not the diſpoſal of other mens wills, and cannot make them come to us only when we pleaſe to call them? why may we not be contented to let all neceſſary affairs take as much of our time as they aſk, ſeeing God will have us ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed? <hi>Contented,</hi> I ſay, for I did never yet forbid you to deſire more time wherein to recollect your ſelf and retire unto God; but would rather have you to wiſh for that, while you are forced to ſerve other things. He is not to be commended that is glad of a multitude of buſineſſes, and loves (as we ſay) to have his hands full of the World; but yet he is no wayes deſerving of our praiſe neither, who when his Calling thruſts it upon him and he is got into the midſt of it, is ſtill bewailing himſelf and troubled at his portion. The true way to peace is, to ſet our hands with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to the neceſſary works of our calling, but to ſet our hearts upon the more immediate ſervice of our Lord. To do our buſineſs, whatſoever multiplicity there happen to be in it; but to long to do ſomething
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:101895:178"/>elſe, if that would permit us. Yet ſtill I ſay we muſt ſo long after the Higher life, that our deſires do not breed in us any diſguſt or impatience in the Lower; which will both make our buſineſs longer and unfit us for our ſpiritual employments.</p>
               <p>You remember I make no doubt the ſtory of <hi>Jacob,</hi> how much he was inamoured of fair <hi>Rachel;</hi> but that though he ſerved ſeveral years for her, yet he was put off with the embraces of <hi>Leah</hi> and forced to endure another apprenticeſhip for his moſt beloved. And the reaſon of it you know is there rendred, becauſe it was not the faſhion of that Country to diſpoſe of the Youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger before the Elder Siſter. I have ſometimes thought that this may not unfitly be accommodated to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto us the eſtate and condition of Pious ſouls while they are like <hi>Jacob</hi> in this Pilgrimage far from their Fathers houſe. They are extreamly deſirous to be wholly wedded to the fair and amiable life of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, Prayer and conſtant paſſions of love of God. This they court and woe above all other things, hoping in a little time to obtain their ſuit and ſpend their dayes in ſuch happy enjoyments. But ſo it is, that they muſt be employed a long while other wayes, before they can reaſonably expect to arrive at the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of being wholly ſequeſtred unto that Life. And ſuch is the neceſſity of this World that when we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine we ſhall now be at perfect leiſure for it; ſome thing or other ſtill thruſts us into a different way of living. Nay the manner of this Country is ſuch, that we muſt be contented to ſerve firſt in theſe baſer em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, before we can be permitted to come to thoſe nobler retirements. With this Worldly life we all begin and it is the Elder of the two. Nay, moſt of
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:101895:179"/>us are forced by many years labour in providing for the lower man, to procure to our ſelves a liberty of being more vacant to the ſervice of our ſouls. And it it is very well, I aſſure you, if after more years then <hi>Jacob</hi> ſerved, God ſhall be pleaſed to bleſs us with ſuch a proportion of theſe Worldly goods, that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our ſelves with greater quietneſs in the boſome of a more contemplative life. Then we may be allowed in compare with this beautiful <hi>Rachel,</hi> to hate <hi>Leah</hi> and all her earthly buſineſs: yea it will be expected at our hands when we are furniſhed as <hi>Jacob</hi> was with flocks and herds and can ſay, We have enough; that we quit the world and retreat from our ſecular affairs and betake our ſelves more intirely to the Higher life. And this favour perhaps our Lord may indulge us, when we are grown a little older and ſhall be more ripe for it; but till that time let us be patient as the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch was; and in hope at laſt to injoy this ſweet, this beloved life, not ſuffer the other to ſeem at all a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtate unto us.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe did not a little gratifie our young Traveller, who now fancied himſelf another <hi>Jacob;</hi> wiſhing for nothing ſo much as to have the fair Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel we ſpoke of given him to be his wife. And ſo much he had impreſſed his mind with the Idea of that more excellent converſation, that had it not been for the laſt words his Friend ſpake and that he conſidered alſo it is wont to remain like <hi>Rachel</hi> a great while, more bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren then the other; he had faln into reproaches of this <hi>Blear-eyed</hi> life, which makes us ſuch ſtrangers to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viner objects, that when we behold them our eyes ſmart and grow ſore by reaſon of their ſplendor. It is too little to ſay that he loved it; for he burnt with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:101895:179"/>after it. When he was employed about the affairs of this life, the time ſeemed like the cold froſty nights wherein <hi>Jacob</hi> kept the flocks of <hi>Laban</hi> in the field. Then were his Sunſhine dayes, and his Heart all in an ardor of Love and Joy, when he was within doors ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the herd of the World and ſhut up with God in his Soul. If there was any heat and eagerneſs in the diſpatch of his ordinary buſineſs, it was by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection from theſe greater flames; which excited him to purſue that with the more agility, that he might the ſooner quit his hands of it, and be free for God.</p>
               <p>And thus having placed his affections, I need not tell you how oft he uſed to ſteal a glance of thoſe Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly objects, even when he was in the midſt of ſome of his worldly occaſions. This I alwayes obſerved, that when it was left to his own choice what part he would take to manage; he would ever lay hold on that which would give moſt liberty for his thoughts, to withdraw themſelves ſometimes to better things. And having good <hi>Jacob</hi> ſo much in his mind, he uſed to ſay that he wondred the <hi>Shepheards</hi> of all other men were not moſt envyed (whoſe name God hath aſſumed into his Titles) becauſe their life is ſo like to His who rules the whole World and yet enjoyes himſelf. For his part as he paſſed along in his journey and ſaw thoſe Swains with their Sheephooks in their hands, he could not for his life but fancy them to be Scepters, and the men to be ſo many petty Kings, whoſe obedient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple left them nothing elſe to do but to pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. O happy Soveraigns, was he wont to ſay, who have ſuch peaceable ſubjects! O Princely Souls whoſe Royalty is attended with none of thoſe enemies of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which make the Thrones of others uneaſie!
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:101895:180"/>There is none privy to what you do, but only your ſelves. None of thoſe Ceremonies trouble you, which incumber all the actions of Kings. You live in the Kingdom of Wiſdom. Your minds are free for the nobleſt contemplations. Your Court is frequented with no flatterers. And it is not hard for you to know thoſe that love your perſons from thoſe that love your fortune. You are not enforced either to be loaded with Cares, or elſe with the reproach of being negligent. Your leiſure is far better then all the imployments which others ſeek. It it is better to want with you, then to abound with all the World beſide. Your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts are far in my eſteem before the Glory of Princely Pallaces. And there are no chains ſo well made or ſo fairly guilded over, that could tempt me out of your Liberty.</p>
               <p>When he had recovered himſelf out of theſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant tranſports, he oftentimes fell into a very ſober commendation of Solitude: which he uſed to call the Gate that lets into the inward World, the ſuburbs of Heaven, and the Miſtreſs of ſuch noble ſatisfactions as the Courts of Kings cannot equal. The profit of this hidden and unknown life, ſaid he, is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; when obſcuring our ſelves in our own Souls we have the greater light within; and communicating ſolely with our Lord, in that one object we enjoy more then all the World. So Neceſſary it is, that I find he cannot be wiſe that is not retired. He muſt be a Fool that ſhuns his own company. He thinks all things better then himſelf, who forſakes himſelf to be with them. If the World had not loſt their wits they would not thus ſlight and paſs by their own Souls, If their taſt were not ſpoiled, they would find more Delight
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:101895:180"/>as well as more profit at home, than can be enjoyed abroad. Though peace and innocence make no great noiſe, yet their undiſturbed pleaſures yield the higheſt contentment. Their pleaſures are ſuch that it is hard for great perſons and thoſe who are much in the World to take their ſhare in them. And as for all others, ſince we muſt divide them with thoſe men whom by no means we would be like, they cannot import very much to our ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>A great number of other things he heaped up in praiſe of this private life, till at laſt he endeavoured to derive honour upon it from the example of our Lord who he thought was much delighted in it. For he obſerved that it was thirty years before he would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the World; and that after he did appear, he was wont very often to retire himſelf even from the company of his own family. And I think he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a great deal more in this Argument, had not his Companion here interpoſed this ſudden queſtion. What then? are you ſo affected to this life as to wiſh you may be left alone? You mean belike to quit me too, and turn an Hermite to enjoy your ſelf the better, when no body ſhares in your affections. By no means, replyed the Filgrim as haſtily: for though he is never alone who is accompanied with noble thoughts; yet I ſhould think my ſelf too much alone without your company. This Solitude doth not exclude our Friends but rather make room for them. We cannot enjoy whom we would, unleſs we retire and ſeparate our ſelves from the multitude. There we may pick and chuſe, but in the crowd men will thruſt themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. And therefore I would be alone that I may have more of you. I would go aſide from the World,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:101895:181"/>that I may not be drawn ſo much from you. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed whatſoever profit or pleaſure there is that I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in this private life, they muſt needs be multiplied by the company of a friend to whom I may impart the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits that I receive. The moſt plentiful feaſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a companion, is the Life of a Lion or of a Wolk. Let my fulneſs be never ſo great, I ſhall ſuffer hunger, as long as I want one of your goodneſs to taſt my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs with me. We were taught, I remember, at School, that Reſt in ancient times was ſtiled <hi>The Food of the gods;</hi> and therefore I have ſince thought that a retreat from buſineſs cannot but be very neceſſary for man. But as their leiſure was thought to be ſweeteſt when they enjoyed it together; ſo I conceive will my Solitude be, if you think good alſo to live alone with me. I do not fancy there are any Anchorets in the the other World. There are no Deſarts in thoſe ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Plains which we ſee above. The Heavenly Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures love Society, and therefore I will not labour to be unlike them. And indeed, if I were perfectly ſhut up in my own ſoul, I could not make it ſuch an Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage, but that the Image of you would ſtill dwell with me.</p>
               <p>Well, ſaid the Father, I am very much beholden to you, that you will make me the Companion of your moſt ſecret pleaſures: and it layes a great obligation on me to be good, if it were but for this only; that there may be no Image imprinted on ſuch a ſoul as yours, but what is fair and lovely. It muſt be confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed alſo, that there is very great uſe of Solitarineſs, eſpecially in the beginnings of a New Life. Then if one ſhould aſk me, What ſhall I fly? I would anſwer, as one of the Philoſophers did, Fly the multitude. For
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:101895:181"/>while a man is weak in Vertue, he is like to one that hath been long ſick; if you ſtir him from the place where he is, he grows worſe. Such a man can ſcarce return back from the world with the manners he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out with him. Something that he had compoſed, is put into diſorder: Some evil that he had chaſed away, comes back to him unawares: ſome good reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution which he had formed, is loſt in a great croud of temptations: and the bad cuſtoms which he had ſhaken off, will endeavour again to renew their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. All places being full of ill examples, there is the greater danger of infection. There is none but either commends a vice, or impreſſes it on us, or ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rubs us with it. And it is very hard to beat off the aſſaults of enemies, when they come in ſo great troops upon us. It is good counſel therefore at ſuch a time: Retire into your ſelf. Shut up your ſoul within doors, and let it not ſtir abroad. And truly he hath very honourable thoughts of us, who thinks us fit to bear our ſelves company. He repoſes a great confidence in us who dares truſt us to our ſelves. For there is no worſe ſociety for a man than his own, if he do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to become good. Fools and mad men ought not to be left in their own hands. For as the wiſe employ their Solitude in pious counſels, and ſober advices for the good government of themſelves: ſo the wicked then meditate bad deſigns, and plot the fulfilling of naughty deſires. They whet their anger, or irritate their luſt, or brazen their foreheads to commit all vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany: and what fear and ſhame concealed from the world, they bring forth then before themſelves, and prepare it to come abroad. See then what a good opinion I have conceived of you, in that I bid you not to fly your ſelf. I muſt needs take you for a man of
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:101895:182"/>worthy thoughts, or elſe I ſhould not permit you to be alone. And let me tell you, that I promiſe my ſelf you will improve your own company ſo well, as to be worthy at laſt to be truſted in the open World. When your mind is well fortified, and your reſolution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; the World will need ſuch a good example, to reform the evil wherewith it abounds. We are not born for our ſelves alone; but others muſt feel there is a good man ſtill remaining among them. It is fit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that at certain times you ſhould all your life ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſter your ſelf from men; ſo it be without affectation of ſingularity, or making any noiſe: but there you muſt not bury your ſelf; nor make your Cloſet a Tomb, wherin to converſe with no body but the dead. Your Light muſt ſo ſhine before men, that ſeeing your good works, they may glorifie your Father which is in Heaven. And you muſt ſhew forth the praiſes of him, who hath called you out of darkneſs into his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Light. But having given you an example of both theſe in the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> I will not ſuſpect your memory of ſo much unfaithfulneſs, as to think you ſtand in need to have thoſe inſtructions repeated. I will rather pray you to let me know how you find your ſelf in thoſe retirements, and whether you meet with ſo great ſatisfaction in them as now you expect to reap.</p>
               <p>And truly afterward he confeſſed, that making his retreat very frequently into this Soveraign Privacy, he could not alway be Maſter of thoſe brave thoughts which he imagined he ſhould have enjoyed. That Life he ſaw had its imperfections, and he lookt to enjoy there thoſe delightful ſpectacles, which too often with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew themſelves from his ſight, and could not be woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:101895:182"/>to favour him with their continual preſence. He found that we do not yet live in the Country of Idaea's and the Land of Perfections: but that we dwell in lower Regions, andare forced to travel among Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeras', and to fight many times with monſtrous Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations. At the beſt we do but ſee the ſhadows of things; or if we gain a true Image of them, yet we muſt be content to ſit down a great way on this ſide of that excellent life, the Image of which we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in our mind. The Pattern is too big for us while we are ſhut up in theſe Priſons. And to be ſo free in our thoughts and affections; it is neceſſary that we obtain a releaſe from theſe bodies. Only thus much benefit he reaped from this dear Solitude wherein he ſometimes reigned; that he was verily perſwaded he ſhould one day arrive at the Freedom and Peace of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> He could not think that his Soul ſhould alwayes dwell ſo far ſhort of that happy Country, of which he had ſuch a lovely picture in his mind. It ſeemed unreaſonable to imagine, that when all other things are ſuffered to grow to their height and utmoſt perfection; the ſpirit of man only ſhould ever remain a dwarf, or rather continue a child, and never be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſed from its ſwadling-bands. No, no; would he frequently ſay, I feel my Soul untying theſe Bands. It grows too great for theſe cloaths, and cannot ſuffer it ſelf to be thus confined. It aſpires to that happy State which admits of no defects, and will make me call my ſelf a Man. It longs and groans to be above it ſelf. It ſtretches its hands to reach the Perfection of Purity, and to lay hold on Eternal Life. It would fain remove from theſe ſhadows and hopes to converſe with the very things themſelves. Oh how it ſighs to do what it now deſigns! How it breathes after the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:101895:183"/>of that which it hath in deſire! The day will come ſure that ſhall caſt no cloud about my mind, nor ſtir the leaſt breath of inordinate paſſion in my ſoul. It will not be long before I be alwayes ſerene, and have the happineſs to live in a conſtant tranquillity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troubled repoſe. The time I believe haſtens when my knowledge ſhall be ſo clear, that Faith ſhall find no employment, and Hope ſhall receive a diſcharge; and Charity ſhall be left alone in its full ſtrength.</p>
               <p>With theſe and other ſuch like pleaſant thoughts they entertained themſelves as they travelled over ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fair Plains; deceiving the length of the Miles by the variety of Diſcourſe, and the prettineſs of ſundry contemplations. For the truth is, His Good Angel (as I may call him) never fail'd to put him in mind of ſuch things as might be worthy of obſervation in their Journey, or might adminiſter a profitable or innocent delight to ſweeten their way. And among other things I remember that one day as they went through a certain place, which was more like a Garden than an High-way; He aſkt him if he was not afraid of thoſe ſtrange Beaſts in green ſkins, and thoſe armed men with weapons of the ſame colour in their hands. At which he ſmiling ſaid; though you have been conſcious to much of my weakneſs, yet I have ſo much courage, as not to be affrighted at the Images of things which I ſee cut in hedges. You ſhall ſee how confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently I will walk naked by that Lyon, and that the Bear in the other thicket ſhall ſtrike no terrour into me. And it pleaſes me very much to think that the trouble which my often-infirmities have given you is not ſo great, but that you can make your ſelf merry with them: and I am willing to recreate you a little
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:101895:183"/>more by bragging thus of my preſent boldneſs. Indeed, ſaid the Father, you could not have well gratified me more than you do, inſporting with that which others more moroſe would have taken for a reproach. But let us ſeriouſly I pray you conſider; Is there much more harm in many of thoſe things at which the world is wont to tremble? Do they not fly from terrible no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, wherewith they ſee the wayes of Piety are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet. The Reproaches which tear our names in pieces like a Lyon; the bitter words which mens tongues ſhoot like arrows in our faces; nay that great Bear, Poverty which turns ſo many out of the way; What are they? If you view them and all their fellows well, you will find they are as innocent, nay as profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table too as thoſe peaceable creatures which you here behold. They are but like thoſe Bows which are made of Bayes, and can do no hurt. Or like thoſe Guns which you ſee wrought in Roſemary and Sweet-Brier, and ſuch like things, which ſhoot flowers, and dart forth Muſk. Or like thoſe Beaſts of Hyſop and Thyme which are very Medicinal to thoſe who know how to uſe them.</p>
               <p>From hence he fell into a very grave advice (which he ſaid could not be too often repeated) that he ſhould not fail to give God thanks for thoſe things which went croſs unto him, as much as he was wont to do for thoſe which were moſt conformable to his deſires. He ſhew'd him how we ſtand indebted to Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence not only for our Food, but for our Phyſick alſo. He made him underſtand how the contempt we meet with from men, doth purge out Pride; how Poverty cures our Luxury and wanton deſires; and how no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſo powerful as Sickneſs to deliver us from the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:101895:184"/>great evil of Ingratitude: it being ſeldom known that men conſider the vaſt benefits of health till they be without it. In ſhort, he convinced him plainly that a great fulneſs of all things, is very apt to choak the ſenſe of God. That when men are in conſtant proſperity, as they want not abilities and inſtruments to ſin, ſo they want the ſtrong reſtraints of fear, of modeſty, and of good counſel to keep them from it. And though, ſaid he, if they wanted the laſt only, their condition would be ſad enough; yet it is ſeldom known that they have the benefit of it, becauſe there is either none to give it, or they are not apt to receive it. But adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity will flatter no man, it ſelf ſupplying the place of an hundred Monitors; and being the only ſober and truſty Counſellor, which great men have in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. And if there were no other advantage that it brings, we ſhould have great reaſon to thank God, that he would not let us dye without the company of a faithful friend.</p>

               <head type="sub">How the Pilgrim grew very dull and lazy. By what means he was quickned to greater diligence. How the Guide awakened ſome ſluggiſh Pilgrims which they met withall: moving them to a great care of their Souls; and to prove their Sincerity in Religion, by their being zealous of good works.</head>
               <p>BUt as I may not be permitted to relate all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful diſcourſe of this nature which paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them in their travels; ſo you muſt not think that our Pilgrim had now leſt all trouble behind him,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:101895:184"/>never to overtake him more. For having thus ſpent his time for ſome weeks, he felt himſelf exceeding dull; and through ſome indiſpoſition (the cauſe of which he could not diſcover) he began to be ſo lazy &amp; liſtleſs to any good action, which had formerly been his delight; that it indangered to overwhelm him in a new affliction of mind. But yet it pleaſed God ſo to order it, that this cloud was caſt about him without any ſhowre; and he cured himſelf of this reſtiffneſs of ſpirit by ſome common obſervations which he made as he went along. For they had not travelled far, before they found a great number of men digging in a Mine, who were all bath'd in their own Sweat; and in ſtead of the freſh air to cool them, were in perpetual danger of Suffocation by infernal vapours. And being aſkt, For what they took ſuch exceſſive pains, they gave them to underſtand that the beſt of their wages was very ſmall, and that ſome were ſuch ſlaves as laboured meerly for coarſe food; not ſo much as a grain of all the Silver Oar which they raked out of the earths bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels coming into their poſſeſſion. At the ſight of which he was ſtrangely awakned, and falling into a mighty paſſion began to reproach himſelf, to accuſe his great folly, and to condemn his ſloth; who was leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for a Soul, then theſe men for a belly-full of meat, or a few ſingle-pennies. What do we, O my Soul? (ſaid the good Pilgrim), Why do we ly ſtill, and ſuffer our ſelves to periſh? Are there any pains like thoſe to which theſe wretches are condemn'd? Or are there any treaſures that can equal thoſe which we are ſeeking after? O how diſproportionable are their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours unto their gains! And how much will our gains exceed the greateſt of our pains! Bluſh, O my Soul, at thy own neglects: and be aſtoniſhed either at their
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:101895:185"/>diligence, or thy own ſloth. Or rather, let the ſtrage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the one, make thee marvel at the other. And for very ſhame, let it rouze thee to do that for thy ſelf which they do for their bodies; or to be but at half the labour to attain eternal Treaſures, which they take, not for periſhing Riches, but for a morſel of meat which only prepares them to renew their labours. In ſuch Meditations as theſe, he ſpent ſome time to the no ſmall quickening of his Soul in well doing. Which were alſo happily revived the next day by the fight of ſome ſhips, which from a mountain that they paſſed over, he eſpied riding on the Sea: whoſe waves did then ſo work and boil that the face of it was all yeſty, and it foam'd with rage at the winds which ſpent their fury upon it. From hence he took occaſion to conſider the hazzard which they run, who truſted themſelves to that treacherous Element: how they were carryed ſometimes to unſeen regions, of which they had no knowledge but by the uncertain reports of others. How uncertain their Returns were: and how the poor Marriners had no intereſt at all in the goods which they ventured their lives to bring home to other Owners. This inſpired his Soul and ſwell'd it with new reſolutions, more then a ſtrong gale of wind doth the ſails of a ſhip when ſhe runs before it. He deſpiſed all dangers. He defied the lazy diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein he lately found himſelf. He applauded the reaſonableneſs of Chriſtian Piety which was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by Faith to unknown Countries. And he vowed never to quit the deſign wherein he was embarqued; Eſpecially ſince he had ſo good aſſurance at laſt to come to an happy Port. From whence he alſo knew that he ſhould never loſe any more, to be thus toſſed in doubts and fears; to be expoſed to the ſtorms of an
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:101895:185"/>angry World, and (which was moſt troubleſome) to conflict with the great uncertainties of his own tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, whereby he was ſometimes lifted up as high as Heaven, and then again depreſſed as low as Hell.</p>
               <p>And truly after this I heard that he continued <hi>very fervent in Spirit, ſerving the Lord.</hi> In ſo much that meeting a good while after with ſome Pilgrims who were remiſs and negligent, a great zeal was kindled in him and he called upon his Guide very earneſtly to uſe his ſpurs and prick them up to a greater diligence. Which motion you will eaſily think the Good Father was not backward to embrace; but drawing a little nearer to them and well obſerving their careleſs po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, he aſkt them what the reaſon might be of that lazy and wretchleſs life which men of their profeſſion lead. Are you not convinced, ſaid he, of the truth of that Religion which is taught by Chriſt? Do you take <hi>Jeſus</hi> for an impoſtor, and think that he lyes in his grave and never ſhall come to Judge the World by his Laws? Or do you think that he hath commanded impoſſible things, and made a Law which cannot be put in uſe and practice? How then ſhall he Judge the World in Righteouſneſs? Or how came it to paſs that you undertook his ſervice if you thought that none can come in his wayes to the happineſs of <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> For my part I can ſee nothing that ſhould make it ſeem impoſſible to be ſo good as Chriſt hath required, but only the lives of a number of ſuch wretches as your ſelves. And leſt I ſhould ſeem to reproach you, or my words ſhould not meet with due regard from you; hearken I beſeech you to the language of one, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed commands your attention, if it be but for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence which you bear to his years, and the place
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:101895:186"/>which he held in the Church of God. It is the famous Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> which I mean, who thus awakens ſome ſuch drowſie ſouls as yours. <hi>Suppoſe a Gentile, ſaith he, ſhould come to thee and ſay, If thou lookeſt for a Kingdom in Heaven, why doſt thou mind this World ſo much? Sure thou doſt but talk; they are but words which thou telleſt to us. If thou expectest the dreadful tribunal of Christ hereafter, why dost thou not deſpiſe the most terrible things that threaten thee in this life? If thou expecteſt immortality, why do we not ſee thee laugh at death? What anſwer now wilt thou return to this Objector? What wilt thou ſay for thy ſelf who trembleſt at the loſs of a little Riches for the Kingdom of Heavens ſake, and rejoyceſt at the gain of a farthing as if it were a great prize? This is that which ſcandalizes the Gentiles, and makes them mock both at thee and thy Religion too. Do not therefore ſtudy ſo much to apologize for it by thy Words, as by thy Deeds. Let him ſee ſuch a one as Chriſt deſcribes, not only in thy Books but in thy Self. Make it manifest to him that there is ſuch a Religion in being, alive in the World; and that it lyes not dead in Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Suffer it not to be the work of the Scribe, or (as we now ſpeak) of the Printer only, but let him read it in thy life. Make him confeſs that the Goſpel commands things that may be done, and doth not draw a Platonical Common-wealth, or deſcribe (as we ſay in theſe dayes) an Eutopian Polity. Suppoſe again, that a Gentile ſhould ſay to thee, Good Sir, how ſhall I know that your God requires poſſible things? They look like things which cannot be done; and I never ſaw any Christian ſuch a man. Behold, thou waſt brought up in thy Religion from thy childhood and yet doſt no ſuch things; with what face then doſt thou require them of me who have been long accuſtomed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes? What wilt thou now reply in the behalf of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity?
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:101895:186"/>Perhaps thou wilt point him to others and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him not to look on thy ſelf. Thou wilt bid him caſt his eyes upon the Monks and thoſe who live in Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, where he may behold what holy lives they lead. O moſt ſhameful Apology! For he will ſay; what then, muſt I turn a Monk? muſt I live in Mountains and dwell in the Deſarts? Muſt I forſake all company but only that of the Beaſts? This is a ſtrange Religion of which a man cannot be, unleſs he leave the Society of men. A Religion that cannot dwell in Towns and Cities. A Religion that flyes the light, and ſeeks for Dens and Caves of the Earth. That is an enemy to the best of pleaſures; that baniſhes good neighbourhood, and renders a man an hater of the rest of Mankind. I will none of this Religion: keep it to your ſelf and do not invite me to your melancholy Piety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This truly is a very great diſgrace to the Christian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to make as though it could not inhabit any place and be perform'd by any men. There is no excuſe to be made for it: If it cannot ſtay with us in Towns and keep us company in buſineſs, and be the employment of common men; away with it; it is not for our turn; let it be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the World. Show to me a man that hath a wife and children and ſervants and yet is a Christian. Let me ſee a man that keeps his ſhop and buys and ſells, and yet lives well and keeps the Laws of Christ. Doth not our Saviour ſay,</hi> Let your light ſhine before men? <hi>but where do we read that it is to illuſtrate Deſarts, and make the Mountains glorious? Which is not ſpoken (ſaith he) to reproach thoſe perſons who chuſe to dwell in ſuch places; but only to bemoan our Cities that have driven Vertue from among them, and thrust it out of their gates into the Wilderneſs. Let us indeavour I beſeech you to call it back
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:101895:187"/>again. Let us bring it to dwell within the Walls of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as well as thoſe of Monaſteries. Let us reduce it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Families, and our ſhops and our Markets, nay into our Taverns and Victualling-houſes. Let us render it Sociable and fit for Converſation that all men may be the better for it. Suffer no place to be void of Religion; but make it extend it ſelf like the Divine Preſence, which is ready to aſſiſt men every where. Do not ſay any longer that you cannot be good. He never took the buſineſs ſeriouſly into his thoughts; he never gave all diligence, who ſpeaks that wicked word. And do not ſay to me neither that you cannot underſtand the Religion of Christ, and know not what to do. For ſee how skilfull the moſt ſimple people are in their worldly affairs; ſee what exactneſs they uſe; how accurate and circumſpect they are wont to be in ſome of their outward concerns. Let them imploy the ſame in ſpiritual things and Ile warrant they ſhall not be overlookt by the Divine grace, nor miſs of being wiſe to Salvation. The Sun ſhines not ſo clear as the Truth of God. Where men have a mind they may eaſily come to the knowledge of him. If they would but attend and not make a By-work of it, they would neither be ſo ignorant, nor ſo impotent as they are. For the Goſpel was not ſhut up in</hi> Palaeſtine, <hi>nor confined to ſome corner of the World, but</hi> all ſhall know me <hi>(ſaith the Lord)</hi> from the greateſt to the leaſt; <hi>and every place may become an</hi> Holy-Land. <hi>But will you extend this thing: may ſome ſay: to the Barbarous Nations, and the ruſtick underſtandings? Yes that I will; and if there can be any still more Barbarous than thoſe that we yet know, I affirm that they may have the benefit of it. For tell me I pray you, ſince one of thoſe men can in things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to this preſent life argue for himſelf if he be wrong'd, reſiſt when he ſuffers violence, and do all things not to be endamaged in the leaſt; why may he not uſe the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:101895:187"/>ſame underſtanding in better matters? When he is to worſhip a ſtone, to obſerve the numerous ceremonies of a fooliſh Feaſt; to do reverence to a falſe God, he can ſhow wit enough; and therefore why do you tell me that he is ſimple and ſilly and capable of Nothing when I would have him ſeek after the Will of the true God? Fie upon you! I wonder you have the face to ſpeak theſe things. There is no ſuch matter: It cannot be as you ſay. Let me never hear you talk thus vainly any more, nor excuſe your ſelves and others in this faſhion.</hi> Their ſimpleneſs is not in fault, but their Idleneſs and ſloth ought to bear the blame. <hi>For I pray you once more conſider, who were more Ruſtick, plain and ſimple? thoſe that lived in</hi> Abrahams <hi>time, or the men of our dayes? It is plain that they. And when was it eaſier to be godly; then, or now? It is manifeſt that now. For now God is more clearly revealed; now the Goſpel is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; now we are taught by the Son of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but then men learnt as one may ſay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any teacher. There was an univerſal corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; no Law give, no Prophets ſent, no Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought: but they ſaw as it were in a profound darkneſs; in a Winter Moonleſs night. Well then, why ſhouldſt not thou be Religious as well or rather more, then</hi> Abraham? <hi>He was of that Noble and generous Spirit which is recorded in the Holy Books, when he had not ſo much as that which we call the</hi> Wiſdom of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, <hi>and there were no Philoſophers in the world. Then I ſay he knew God, he wrought righteouſneſs, he exerciſed Vertue, he drew on others to be godly. Nay, his Father was an Idolater, his Friends and kindred were immers'd in the evil cuſtoms of the World, and yet all this could not hinder him from becoming good, and obeying the call of God. It cannot then be impoſſible for us who live in
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:101895:188"/>the clear day light, both to know, and do his will: But it is impoſſible, utterly impoſſible that he ſhould leave them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Almighty grace, who are vigilant and watchful to attend to the illuminations which he beſtows upon them. Never think hereafter to make Apologies for your ſelves before God, ſeeing you are not able to anſwer for your ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſs before men. They condemn you, and he will never acquit you. It is viſible you may be better, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will admit of no excuſe for your continuing bad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the effect of the Sermon which that Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent man made to Drones and Sluggards: and let me again beſeech you to lay his words to heart. Do not content your ſelves with wiſhes and deſires, no nor with ardent prayers that you may be amended; but apply your ſelves to the work, ſtir up the Grace that is in you, and do what your hands find to do with all your might. They are the Souls whoſe Prayers God hears, who employ their hands as ſoon as they have unbent their knees. The diligent and the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring men are thoſe whom he comes to aſſiſt. A man may work wonders, but not if he lye in a Bed. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will pour down abundance of Grace, but not if we gape for it at home, and will not go out of doors to receive it. You have heard its like of the <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Legion</hi> for whom God fought, but yet they did not obtain the Victory with their arms a croſs: they were fain to give blows, as well as believe, and to ſecond their Prayers with their Swords. We may praiſe the fertile ſoyl, and pray for ſeaſonable ſhowers; but let me tell you, no rain fructifies more then the dew of Sweat. Though the Ship waits for a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able gale, and cannot ſtir without it; yet it is ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calm'd
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:101895:188"/>without that breath wherewith they hoiſe the ſails, and ſpread them to receive it.</p>
               <p>It would be too long to tell you what commotions the poor men felt in their breaſts all the time that he was ſpeaking: but thus much you may know that they began to be ſo awakned, and ſeemed ſo much aſhamed; that he thought it beſt to ſtrike again while the Iron was hot, and his words had ſuch fair hopes to make a deeper impreſſion. To this diſcourſe therefore he added another, which he conceived might give a greater force unto it, and was of this import. But leſt, ſaid he, you ſhould imagine this Eminent perſon whoſe ſenſe of things I have conveighed to you to have meaſured the ſtrength of other men by his own great abilities; I will read a lecture out of a a Philoſopher to you, who is able to ſay enough to make you ſhake off your ſloth, and cannot be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of more knowledge, then may be the portion of Chriſts diſciples. And I perſwade my ſelf that you cannot for ſhame deſpiſe his words, leſt he having nobler thoughts then your ſelves ſhould ſerve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you of the groſſeſt ſtupidity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You have all I am ſure a very ſtrong deſire of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is good, and not contented with any inferior degree; you all long for that which is Supream, and hath nothing above it. Now God, ſaith he, and Goodneſs are ſo near of kin that they are convertible, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find the one, but you muſt have the other alſo. Whereſoever you can meet with the Eſſence of God (he means a participation of him) there is the eſſence of Good. What then is the Eſſence of God, where ſhall we find his Nature? Is this Fleſh the thing we enquire after?
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:101895:189"/>Far be ſuch a thought from us. Is that field, or thoſe mannors? away with ſuch an abſurd conceit. Is fame, is glory? No ſuch matter. What then? Is mind and underſtanding, knowledge and wiſdom, right reaſon and ſound apprehenſions? Yes, this is the thing we look for: here we find God, and therefore here let us ſeek for the Nature of Good. He is no where elſe to be met withall, and therefore let us go no farther to be happy. For elſe why doſt not thou ſeek for this Good in a plant? why doſt thou not expect to find it in a Brute? Theſe and all other creatures are indeed the Works of God, but they are not the Principal and chief; they are not a part of him; they are not the things wherein he hath engraven himſelf, and wrought his own Image. It is thou that art the prime of his creatures; that art his Maſter-piece: nay thou art (as I may ſay) a piece of God; thou haſt in thy ſelf a portion of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. Why then art thou ſo Ignorant of thy No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility? why doſt thou forget ſo ſhamefully from whence thou art derived? Is it fit for thee to ſeek thy happineſs in meat and drink, in money and lands, in honour and applauſe? Why doſt thou diſparage thy ſoul ſo much as to go for thy Good any farther then thy ſelf? There is God, and there thou muſt enjoy thy Good: It is not any thing in the World thou art to mind, ſo much as thy ſoul; for in that is to be found the ſatisfaction of thy deſires. Why doſt thou not remember then, when thou cateſt, who thou art that cateſt, and whom thou feedeſt? When thou uſeſt any thing in the World who thou art that uſeſt it? And when thou doſt any thing, who it is that doth it? Art thou altogether inſenſible of the excellence of the perſon whom thou feedeſt, and who is here ſent into the world to be trained up by thee? O wretch that thou art, how comes it about that thou art ſo ignorant of this,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:101895:189"/>that thou carryeſt God about with thee? Or doſt thou think that I ſpeak of a God without thee? A god of Gold or Silver to be born on thy ſhoulders? Thou carryeſt him in thy ſelf, man; and yet regardeſt not, though thou doſt pollute him with filthy thoughts, and beſmear him with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and naſty actions. If there be a Statue, a liveleſs Image of God before thine eyes, a picture of him in ſtone, thou dareſt not to do any undecent thing before it. But God himſelf being preſent within, ſeeing all things, and hearing all things, thou bluſheſt not, O thou hated of God, to think and do moſt unworthily, being altogether inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of thy own Nature. If one could ſuppoſe thee to be a Statue made by</hi> Phidias (Minerva <hi>for inſtance, or</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter) <hi>wouldſt thou not, if we could alſo ſuppoſe thee to have any ſenſe, be very mindful of thy ſelf, and of the workman, and do nothing either unbecoming his Art, or thy own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence? And now that thou art made even by Heaven it ſelf, now that thou art the Workmanſhip of God, what is the reaſon that thou careſt not after what manner thou behaveſt thy ſelf? Is not that Image which is made by man, of Stone or Braſs, or of Gold and Ivory at the beſt? And where it is ſet up firſt, there it ſtands for ever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtirring one foot of it ſelf from the place. But who can tell me of what that Image of God is made which he faſhioned with his own hands? What the price of it is, it ſelf cannot underſtand. And yet it ſtirs and moves; it hath a ſpirit, and can go whither it will; it ranges about the world, and cannot be limitted by all that it ſees; it hath a knowledge of good and evil, a reaſon and judgment whereby to eſtimate things. And therefore ſince thou art the Fabrick of ſuch an Artiſt, ſince thou art ſuch an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent piece; why doſt thou diſgrace, why doſt chou underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue thy ſelf? Why I ſay? Seeing thou art not only formed by him, but he hath given thee credit above all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:101895:190"/>he hath depoſited many rare gifts in thy hands, and intruſted thee alone with a great deal of his wealth? Wilt thou not be mindful of this neither, but betray thy truſt, and abuſe and embezzle his goods which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to thy charge? If one ſhould commit an Orphan a poor Fatherleſs and Motherleſs child to thy care, — wouldſt thou be ſo negligent of him? Bethink thy ſelf then; He hath committed to thee thy ſelf; He hath judged none ſo faithful none ſo fit to be truſted as thee. Keep me this, ſaith he, juſt as it is. See that this be preſerved in ſafety and delivered back again unto me, modeſt and baſhful, honeſt and juſt, ſober and temperate, heavenly and ſublime, strong and couragious, peaceful and undiſturbed, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and well pleaſed; in one word, ſuch as I made it. What a piece of infidelity then, what diſhoneſty and falſeneſs is it, that thou wilt not at all guard and ſecure it? What will he ſay unto thee when he ſees it ſo horribly abuſed as we now behold the ſouls of men? What canſt thou expect to be the reward of ſuch treachery, which of all other is the greateſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I ſhould tire you I doubt if I ſhould proceed to the end of this mans Lecture; and I have repeated enough of it to make all your ſouls bluſh at that groſs and ſupine negligence, which makes them obnoxious to the laſh of Heathens. And if you would deal free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clearly, can you ſay that you never heard your Souls complain that they are thus ſlighted? Did they never quarrel with you for your forgetfulneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of them? Are they not apt to murmur and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine that they can receive no higher ſatisfaction than the Brutes enjoy? And do they not remember you that they are of an heavenly deſcent, of the kindred of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, made after the likeneſs of God himſelf? O that
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:101895:190"/>you would but liſten to them; They will fill your ears I am ſure with ſuch ſad lamentations, as will make them tingle. They will tell you it is unſufferable that they ſhould be thus neglected and diſregarded. They will chide you for beſtowing the care that is due to them upon other inconſiderable things. They will reproach to you moſt bitterly this ſleepineſs and carnal ſecurity wherein I find you. And can you be ſo cruel to them as after ſo many complaints to let them have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs? muſt they ſtill ſuffer theſe wrongs and abuſes which have been long offer'd to them? Will you harden your hearts againſt the cryes and clamours of your own Souls? If there be any ſpark of good nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in them, they are mollified to the piteous whinings and the mournful accents of a poor Dog, that is accidentally ſhut up and almoſt ſtarv'd in a loneſome place, and begs for a releaſe. How can they refuſe then to relent at their own doleful cryes and miſerable complaints? How can they hear without ſome ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs their own ſad ſighs and deep groans after a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good then this World affords? Will you not ſuffer them to be ſet at liberty after ſo long reſtraint? Will you not permit them to go to their own kindred, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their native Country when they are ſo deſirous of it? Will you deny them the freedom to think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually of their own proper happineſs, and contrive a ſure way wherein to attain it? Be not ſo unnatural; do not ſo forget your ſelves; but let your Souls have free leave to purſue their deſires. Yea give them op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity every day to look abroad beyond the Body and this preſent World. Or rather invite them to take the freedom to go to God as oft as they pleaſe. And when you find them ſo unmindful of themſelves as now they ſeemed to be; when they are ſo heavy that they
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:101895:191"/>begin to fall aſleep; awake them and ſtir them up again: rouze them from their ſlumber and bid them remember their Dignity and take great heed that they be not gulled with the flatteries and enchantments of the World and of the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>And truly there is very great need of this watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; for the Fleſh will be ſolliciting your attendance, and deſire you to make proviſion for it. It will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of your neglects too; and be angry that it is not more kindly uſed. It will grudge at all the time and care that is beſtowed on your Soul, and ſay it is too much. You muſt expect that it will murmur at the commands of Chriſt, and think it ſelf very much in jured by them. But as you muſt not regard theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, ſo I will tell you a way whereby you ſhall ceaſe them, and make it better ſatisfied. Let it know that if it will not be content with what you do, it ſhall have worſe uſage then hitherto. Tell it that you will not have ſo much kindneſs for it, unleſs it will be quiet. Perſwade it that it is better to conſent to obedience ſooner, for elſe it ſhall fare more hardly, and you will take a ſeverer courſe to bring it under. For ſo I have read that <hi>Hilarion</hi> an ancient Pilgrim, was wont to do. When he found his fleſh to be much diſpleaſed that it was denyed any thing; He inſulted over it on this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion. Thou Aſs! canſt thou not tell when thou art well and haſt but a light burden upon thy back? I will make thee that thou ſhalt not kick again in haſt. I will lay ſuch loads upon thee that thou ſhalt ſtand quietly and have no power to Wince. And I will not feed thee with Corn, but with ſtraw. I will puniſh thee with hunger and thirſt. I will afflict thee with faſting and bring thee low with harder labours. I will make thee
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:101895:191"/>think more of thy meat then of gluttony and riot. Thou ſhalt be glad of a drop of drink, and reſt well content without compotations and exceſs of Wine. Thou hadſt better have been more moderate in thy deſires, for I will teach thee to be well pleaſed with a ſparer diet. It had been more for thine eaſe if thou hadſt been more diligent; for I will cure thee of thy Sloth, by exacting of thee more grievous taſks.</p>
               <p>In this manner he quieted and ſtill'd all its grumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and affrighted away its reluctance and idle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. And in the ſame way may you bring it to ſome reaſon, and make it capable of good advice; leſt by craving too much it have the leſs; and by incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the better part, it loſe the freedom that it doth enjoy. Terrifie your ſelves with the thoughts of ſeverer Diſcipline, which you muſt be forced to uſe: and repreſent to your ſelves effectually, that if there be no other way, this ſluggiſh temper muſt be baniſhed by a rigorous and ſharp pennance, which you can leſs endure than this eaſie ſervice of our Lord. By this means ſure you will procure liberty for your ſouls to follow their nobler propenſions, and to provide for their return to their own Country, and their Fathers Houſe. Which if you mean to effect, then you muſt take more time, whatſoever the Fleſh or the World ſhall object, to conſider more ſeriouſly the worth and price of your Souls, than which I know not what can be more powerful to drive away your ſleep, and to make you attend with all earneſtneſs to the ſecuring of their happineſs. Remember I again beſeech you, that it is too long that you have remained in ignorance of your ſelves. That it is high time now to look about you, leſt your Souls quite forget themſelves, and never
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:101895:192"/>recover the memory of what and whence they are. Let my counſel therefore be acceptable to you, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve very often in your mind the words of that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then whom I have brought hither to make you aſhamed. Retire much into your ſelves, and there demand of your Souls, that they declare their quality and condition to you. They are able to make you an anſwer, and therefore bid them tell you what is their parentage and kindred, of what houſe they are deſcended, what is their nature, their portion, their inheritance, and do not ceaſe till you have received ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. Aſk them if they are not the Daughters of God, Siſters to Angels, Images of Divinity. Hearken if they will not tell you that they are ſpirits of a vaſt underſtanding, purer than the Light, ſwifter than the Lightning; whoſe portion and dowry is immortality, whoſe place is the Univerſe, whoſe capacity is a picture of Infinity, and who are born to be heirs of the other world, to have the honour of being Kings, and to raign with God for ever. And when your ſouls have dealt faithfully with you, and let you know ſuch things as theſe, you muſt be as faithful and juſt to them, and aſſure them that you will have a great care of them, and attend upon them according to their birth and quality. Think what a madneſs it is to throw away this nobler Moity of man, for that which no diſcreet perſon would purchaſe with the loſs of his health, or the price of the pains of the far inferiour part. Let every one of you ſay within himſelf, O my Soul, I will never be perſwaded to loſe thee; nothing ſhall tempt me to be falſe unto thee. This Body ſhall be hungry and ſtarv'd, nay and dye too if it were poſſible a thouſand deaths, rather than I will famiſh thee, and ſuffer thee to periſh. I have reſolved thou ſhalt have
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:101895:192"/>thy true liberty, &amp; purſue thy true end for which thou waſt made. Look about thee, and ſee what thou wouldſt have, and by the Grace of God it ſhall not be denyed to thy deſires. And what is, I beſeech you, O you Sons of men, or rather, you Sons of God, you children of the Moſt High; what is it that you are moſt deſirous to enjoy? Is it not the Knowledge of God, to be acquainted with your Father, to recover his Image, to be impreſſed with his Likeneſs, to live in his Love, to have the Light of his Countenance, to be full of good hopes of receiving his Bleſſing, and to be reſtored at laſt to his preſence after this long baniſhment from him? O gratifie your ſouls then ſo far, as to give all diligence to fulfil theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable longings. Be not ſparing of your pains in ſo great a buſineſs. Let them not be put off with frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous excuſes, that you are not at leiſure, that you have other things to mind for the convenience of your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, or any the like pretences; but inſtantly apply your ſelves more vigorouſly than ever to ſee that they have right done them, and that they receive their true and full ſatisfaction. Do not think it is ſuch a ſmall matter that will content them as the whole World. Nay, do not imagine that it will ſuffice them to talk of the other World; to ſend ſome meſſages to it, and receive ſome from it. It is not enough that they ſpeak now and then with the Father of their Being, and that they have his Word, and hear him ſpeaking to them. But they muſt have a greater communication with them both, than this amounts unto. They muſt ſet their affections on things above: they muſt have their converſation in Heaven: they muſt be like to God, and made partakers of a Divine Nature. They muſt be renewed after the Image of him that created them, in Wiſdom, in Righteouſneſs, in Purity, in Charity and
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:101895:193"/>Love; ſo that God may dwell in them and they in him. No leſs Good than this muſt you deſign for your Souls. You do not act like reaſonable Beings, till you ſeek by all means this conformity with your Original from whence you ſpring. Do you doubt at all of what I ſay? Let me ſend you then to that Philoſopher again, that you may bluſh once more to ſee your ſelves in greater Ignorance than thoſe whom you reproach with the name of Infidels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diogenes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hearing a Sophiſter once making a vain-glorious declamation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">L. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>put forth his middle finger, and pointed at him ſaying; See, there is the man: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, for that is He: now you may look upon him, and know him if you will. At which words there being a great ſtir and tumult excited, he proceeded thus in his ſpeech unto them. Do you think that I ſhew you a man as we do a ſtone or a log, only with the indicatian of my fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? No, I have no ſuch meaning: it is a folly to think of diſtinguiſhing a man from his neighbour by ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument. But when one hath ſhown you his opinions that he hath of things, when he hath demonſtrated to you what are his great concerns; then he hath ſhown him to you as he is a man. And from thence now you may take this mans Character whom you have heard ſpeaking to you. He hath told you what he thinks, and what he moſt deſires: I only bid you to mark and obſerve him. Let us ſee thy opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and notions alſo</hi> (ſaith the Philoſopher who makes application of this ſtory) <hi>Let us behold thy ſentiments that we may be acquainted with thee. Diſcover to us what thou loveſt and chuſeſt above all other things. Doſt thou place thy happineſs without thy ſelf? Doſt thou value all things more than thy ſelf? Thou readeſt the beſt Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, thou ſtudieſt</hi> Chryſippus, <hi>and ſuch good Authors;
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:101895:193"/>and this is all. Why, then we ſee very well who thou art. Haſt thou not diſcovered to us in what eſteem we are to hold thee? A poor-ſpirited Creature, angry and furious, fearful and diſtruſtful, querulous and complaining of every thing, proud and conceited of thy ſelf, covetous and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous, deſirous of glory and popular applauſe, accuſing all things, and never quiet nor at reſt. Theſe things thou ſheweſt us; and by theſe we are to eſteem thee. It is not thy Books, nor thy Maſters and Tutors, nor any thing elſe, but ſuch as theſe that ſhew the man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what I beſeech you can be more proper to be ſpoken in the ears of moſt Chriſtian Auditories? You read the Bible; you have the Books of Chriſtian Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your hands. Do theſe denominate you Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian men and women? Muſt we call you the Diſciples of our Saviour, becauſe you ſit before us, and hear our Sermons. No ſuch matter: Shew us, O man, thy thoughts, ſhew us thy decrees and opinions of things. Let us ſee thy underſtanding, thy will, thy choice, thy affections; that we may know whether thou art a Chriſtian or no. And where ſhall we ſee theſe but in the actions of thy life? Covetouſneſs &amp; love of pleaſure tell us plainly what thou art. Pride and ſtudy to be admired in the World proclaim thee to us more than all that we ſee beſide. If thou wilt give a proof thy Humanity and of thy Chriſtianity too; if thou wilt have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that thou art not yet turned an unreaſonable creature; live according to thy reaſon; practiſe thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; preferr thy Soul before thy Body, the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an immortal Being before the trivial injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a few moments. Do not tell us of thy profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, nor of thy belief, when we ſee with our eyes that which better declares thee to us. Let thy Soul reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:101895:194"/>its command again; let it be reſtored to its Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and Dominion; let it rule all the paſſions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the lower part, that we may know thou art a Man, and not degenerated into a Beaſt.</p>
               <p>And now by this time you may well think theſe Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims were awakened, unleſs they meant to ſnort eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. And indeed the poor men were ſo warm'd, or rather inflamed with this diſcourſe, that they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain themſelves no longer, but burſt forth into a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate weeping; firſt for their fault, and then for joy, that God had ſent them ſo faithful a Monitor. They gave him moſt hearty thanks for his excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon (as they could not chuſe but call it) and promiſed moſt ſolemnly to think more of the value of their Souls, and thereby excite themſelves to uſe their beſt diligence to ſave them. We will go, ſaid they, to the Father of our Spirits: we will make it our conſtant endeavour to reconcile our ſelves to him. We will ſay, Father, we have ſinned againſt Heaven and againſt thee; we have ſinned againſt our ſelves. We have wronged our own Souls; we are no more worthy to be called thy Sons: no not worthy of ſo much as to be called the Sons of men. We have lived like Brutes; we have ſpoiled thy Workmanſhip; and miſerably ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced and mangled thine Image. But we repent, and remember from whence we are faln. We are deſirous now of nothing ſo much, as to be conformed to thy ſelf. O let us be thy ſervants, if we are not worthy to be called thy children. Admit us but into the loweſt place in thy family, to the meaneſt degree of thy Love. And if that be too good a name for us, to be ſtiled thy ſervants; we are willing to be thy Vaſſals, thy Bondſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, any thing that thou wilt have us. For we are
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:101895:194"/>the Captives of thy Mighty and All-conquering Love, and we ſhall think our ſelves happy, if we may ſit in the moſt inferiour rank of thoſe, that ſhall eternally ſing thy Praiſes.</p>

               <head type="sub">How the Pilgrim was falling into the contrary Extreme, and was prevented by his Director.

That it is fit for us for us to love our friends paſſionately: and to take great delight in their company.</head>
               <p>IN ſuch ardent effuſions as theſe they a long time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loadned themſelves of the paſſions which they felt in their hearts. Which being all vented, there ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a very great one for this Good man, which they were not able to utter. Very ſorry they were that it was not poſſible for them alwayes to accompany him, and when they took their leave, it was with ſo many freſh tears and vows of never forgotting his inſtructions, that he thought his ſtay with them promoted him more in his way to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> than many other long dayes Journeyes. Nor was our young Pilgrim without his ſhare in the benefit of this diſcourſe, being hereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to beſtir himſelf with more earneſtneſs and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Zeal in the Service of God. He never thought that he was vigilant enough; He lookt about him as if he had ſeen with an hundred Eyes; and he was as buſie as if he had been Maſter of as many Hands. And
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:101895:195"/>to be ſhort, he was in danger to throw himſelf into the other extreme, by an unbridled and headlong kind of fervour; which carried him to attempt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake more than he was able to perform. Which the Good man eſpying and conſidering that it would ſoon tire him, and ſo bring him into a new trouble; he told him that to make their way ſeem leſs tedious, he would entertain him a little with a ſtory of one of the Pilgrims in former dayes. You have heard, ſaid he, I believe of a famous perſon in <hi>Egypt</hi> called St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> who lead a life ſo holy that there were few places into which his name did not come, &amp; from whence ſome or other did not go to behold ſo rare an example of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Vertue. Among others there were certain Monks on a time went to him to confer about divine matters; &amp; they were ſo earneſt in a diſpute which aroſe among them that it laſted from the beginning of the night, to the next day morning. The thing under debate was this as <hi>John Caſſian</hi> tells us. What Vertue or what obſervance is it, that may be thought of greateſt efficacy to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a Monk in perpetual ſafety from diabolical ſnares and deceits; and to lead him in the beſt way and with greateſt freedom to the top of Perfection? For the reſolution of which doubt, each one according to his capacity, produced what he thought to be moſt avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Some there were who placed all in <hi>Faſtings</hi> and <hi>Watchings;</hi> alledging for proof hereof, that a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extenuated hereby and made very pure in ſoul and body, may more eaſily come to be united with God. Others preferred entire <hi>Poverty</hi> before thoſe, and ſaid that a total contempt of all worldly things was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecurity of man; in regard the mind being naked and quite ſtript of all thoſe impediments, becomes more light and enlarged and may ſpeedily mount to
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:101895:195"/>the heavenly enjoyments. But there were a third ſort who gave the Palm to the love of <hi>Solitude,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Deſarts as the only places wherein to come to familiarity with God, and to hold a perpetual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with his infinite Goodneſs. Nor were they wanting who with a great deal of reaſon preferred the works of <hi>Mercy</hi> and Brotherly Charity before all other exerciſes whatſoever; affirming that nothing would give us ſo good a title to the Kingdom of Heaven nor more readily bring us thither. Thus every one having unfolded his mind and enlarged himſelf as much as he pleaſed in proof of his own opinion, the greater part of the night was conſumed before it came to St. <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>'s turn to ſpeak; who delivered himſelf in manner following.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denyed, my Reverend Brethren, but that the propoſitions by you now made, are of ſingular force to keep a mans heart with God and to bring him to a moſt excellent degree of Vertue. But yet to rely principally on their ſufficiency, innumerable reaſons and events alſo, occurring to divers perſons, will not permit me. I have been a man of ſome obſervation, and many have I ſeen in my time that were given to wondrous abſtinence from meat and ſleep; that were retired from all humane Society; addicted in ſuch ſort to Poverty as not to reſerve a penny for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or a loaf of bread for the future; ſome alwayes at their devotion, others imployed in acts of Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and ſuccouring of their Neighbours; who never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs fell at laſt into ſuch errors &amp; illuſions, that their end proved nothing anſwerable to their magnanimous beginnings. So that I conceive the beſt way to know what will advance us in our deſign of enjoying God
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:101895:196"/>more perfectly and put us in poſſeſſion of that ſtate we aſpire unto, is to ſearch into the occaſion of the ruine and perdition of thoſe unhappy ones. Moſt certain it is they had been gathering together a notable treaſure of good and holy works, what was it then which made it waſt away and come to nothing? Surely the only lack of <hi>Diſcretion.</hi> They had not ſufficiently learned the rules and conditions of this Vertue which ſhunning either extremes, maintains us continually upon the high-way: neither letting us be carried away with the right hand of ſpiritual conſolations, to ſuperfluous and unmeaſurable fervours; nor yet with the left of dryneſs and want of ſpiritual guſt, under colour of care of the Body to fall into ſloth and ſenſuality. This <hi>Diſcretion</hi> is that which our Lord calls the Eye and Lamp of the body, which being clear and ſimple, the whole body will be repleniſhed with light; but being dimme, there will be nothing but darkneſs. To this faculty it belongs to weigh, ballance and diſcern all that is to be done by man and; therefore if this be faulty, and true judgment and knowledge be wanting, the Soul muſt needs be folded up in a night of inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and blind paſſions.</p>
               <p>To this, as there was reaſon, they all gave their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, there being many other things added to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this aſſertion, which it is not pertinent to relate. It is lawful now for me to caſt in my ſuffrage alſo, and to tell you that this <hi>Diſcretion</hi> is it alone which can make our faſtings and Vigils profitable, by directing to the right meaſure, and the due ſeaſon of them. It will teach us not to abſtain when there is need we ſhould eat; and not call it Religion to be miſerably ſick. It will learn us to regard the end; and not faſt in Zeal,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:101895:196"/>but for nothing elſe. And when we do faſt in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to them above us, it will let us underſtand that their Laws are not ſatisfied, but when the intention and purpoſe of them can be obſerved. This alſo is it which will make retirement uſeful, by drawing us out of it upon fit occaſions. This will make us poor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out becoming Beggars: And fervent in devotion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blazing away in the fierceneſs of our own flames. It will direct us ſo to give away our goods, that we may be alwayes giving. And to ſuccour our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, ſo that we may not be wearing of well doing. To communicate common benefits with all, and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar benefits with choice. And to take care (as wiſe men have ſaid) that in making the Portraiture we do not ſpoil this Pattern, and in feeding the Streams we dry not up the Fountain. For God hath made the love of our ſelves the Pattern whereby we are to love our neighbours; and we ſhall not be good to them long, if we mind not firſt our own concerns. It is the Vertue which hinders us from ſpoiling a good deſign through raſhneſs and haſt. It keeps us from tripping up our own heels by running too faſt. It keeps us from being tired, while it keeps us from taking too long, though continued Journeys. It keeps us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes at our work, by keeping us from over-working our ſelves. It makes Religion eaſie and pleaſant by making it free and unconſtrain'd. It brings Religion ſo much into our love, that it will never fall into our hatred. It preſerves us from deſtroying the body while we are labouring to ſave the ſoul. It feeds the ſoul without any gluttony; and ſaves it from nauſeating ſpiritual things by providing that it take no ſurfeit of them. It conducts our affairs with more temper, and leſs rumour; with more effects, and leſs ſhow. It makes
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:101895:197"/>us zealous without raſhneſs; and excites us to do good to our ſelves, without prejudicing the good of others. It quenches the furious heat which affrights the wicked, and diſcourages the weak, and upbraids the ſoberneſs of thoſe who are ſtrong. It ſhews that it is poſſible at once to be Religious and yet Wiſe. It adorns the Goſpel, and is a great grace and ornament to him that wears it. It commends Piety to the World, and doth not impair it in our ſelves. It gives a luſtre to all the Vertues, and they borrow their beauty from it. And in one word, it is at leaſt their Handmaid which muſt ever wait upon them, or elſe they will diſhonour themſelves.</p>
               <p>Our young <hi>Pilgrim</hi> you diſcern by this time was a man of ſo much wit, that he could not but ſee the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this ſtory, and think that it had an aim at him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And being very much cooled and refreſhed by this charitable breath which the Father had ſpent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; he inſtantly apprehended that he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to give him a divertiſement, and an inſtruction both together. For ſometime he could do nothing elſe but commend this Vertue, till at laſt he remembred there was ſome praiſe due to the Father who had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him now ſuch an inſtance of it. And having ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him his thanks both for the leſſon and the ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of it, he aſſured him that he would never travel without this <hi>Diſcretion</hi> about him. No more you had need, ſaid his Companion, for though I called her only the Handmaid of the Vertues, yet in truth ſhe ſeems to be a Miſtreſs among them, and to diſpoſe them to their ſeveral duties. For one Vertue, you muſt know, is in need of its neighbour, and cannot live alone. They muſt help one another continually, or elſe they will
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:101895:197"/>be very lame and defective. They muſt lend to each other a mutual ſupport, or elſe they will be in danger of falling to the ground. Meekneſs muſt lend its hand to Zeal, and Zeal muſt do as much for it again; or elſe the one will be but Fire, and the other will be but Phlegme. Seriouſneſs muſt be beholden to Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; and chearfulneſs muſt call to be repayed by it, or elſe we ſhall be either all earth, or nothing but Air. Humility wants a little confidence; an holy Faith muſt be joyned with ſome Fear; an high Generoſity and great courage is very imperfect without Modeſty; and a ſevere Juſtice muſt be acquainted with ſweetneſs and complacence: Or if the one ſhould refuſe the other this aſſiſtance, it will feel ſuch a want it ſelf, that it will be forced to beg that which it doth deny. But what is it I beſeech you, that pairs and links them thus together, and makes them do this mutual ſervice; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be the <hi>Diſcretion</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> which the Holy man recommended to you? This ſuperintends over all, and iſſues forth her directions and orders to them: which if they be not obeyed, they do moſt hurt where we intended the greateſt good; and they run to the borders of Vice, when we deſigned the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Vertue. This makes a ſweet mixture of Faith in God with fear of our ſelves; of Godly Sorrow with Spiritual Joy; of innocence with prudence; of low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs with greatneſs of mind; of heavenly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with diligence in our Callings; of delight in God, with a pleaſure in our friends, and thoſe who are good. It teaches us to diſcourſe, and not be talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; to be ſilent, but not melancholy; to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with what we have, but not be idle; to labour, but not be impatient; to bear a dear affection to our friends, but not to their faults; to reprove others,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:101895:198"/>and not incur a reproof our ſelves by undue ſeverity towards them.</p>
               <p>Enough, ſaid the Pilgrim; I ſee ſuch need of this Vertue, that you may be confident I ſhall never be willing to be without its company. But truly I think it muſt be your <hi>Diſcretion</hi> more than mine own that will be my ſecurity; for I have been, you ſee, afflicted with ſuch contrary paſſions, that I am ready to wiſh that I had none at all. There is not one of thoſe that I have about me, but it is ſometimes ſuch a trouble to me, that I ſhould think my ſelf more happy if I were wholly deprived of them. They are ſo ſtrong and violent, ſo boiſterous and turbulent, that if they do not overtop my reaſon, yet I cannot overcome them without ſuffering a great tumult and diſorder. What ſhould we do with things which it is ſo hard to rule? Were it not better to diſcharge them all, ſince there needs more diſcretion than I am Maſter of to keep them?</p>
               <p>The Good man was a little troubled to hear him ſpeak after this ſort, and aſkt him with a greater quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than he was wont to uſe. Would you then be well pleaſed if I ſhould bring a Sythe and mow off your leggs? Had you rather be carried than go upon your feet? The poor man was amazed at this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and aſkt him what he meant. My meaning, ſaid the Father, is plain enough. Your paſſions are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but thoſe motions of your ſoul whereby you go to that Good, or run away from that Evil, which your underſtanding preſents to your heart. You would be ſo far from being happy by being deprived of them, that I maintain you could not be happy at all without
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:101895:198"/>them. A Tree would be as happy as you, if you had no deſire, nor love, nor hope, nor none of the reſt of their company. And therefore you may as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have no feet, or to have a Dead-Palſie ſmite your loyns, and diſable you to move; as wiſh to have no paſſions, or to have them ſo benummed and ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that you ſhall not feel them. We muſt not pluck out our eyes for fear they be abuſed with unworthy ſpectacles, nor ſtand ſtock ſtill for fear of falling, nor alwayes ſtay at home becauſe the weather may prove rainy. Nay, When did you ſee any excellent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which was not accompanied with a plentiful por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe? Or, When was there any love or cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage or any ſuch like thing in a noble degree, but you might diſcern it edged with no ſmall paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit? And do not think that our paſſions are of little uſe; for it is plain they are good for more purpoſes than one. There is at leaſt a double end for which they ſerve. They <hi>firſt</hi> incite and diſpoſe the Soul to ſeek thoſe things which are good and neceſſary for us: and then <hi>ſecondly,</hi> they fortifie and conſerve us in this diſpoſition, and make us to perſiſt in our inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to thoſe things which are profitable for us; the thoughts of which elſe might eaſily be blotted out. They ſtir you up, and bring you to that good which objects it ſelf to your mind; and then they impreſs it there, and cauſe it to ſtay with your Soul. For you cannot but obſerve that thoſe things which move you with any paſſion when you ſee or think of them, do ſtick longeſt in your mind: and thoſe with which you are not affected, are but little remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</p>
               <p>All your buſineſs then is (and in that you muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:101895:199"/>ſome pains) to get better eyes to guide you in your goings, and not to endeavour that you may not ſtir at all. You muſt ſtudy I mean to underſtand the true difference between good and evil, to be able to judge what is fit for you, and what not; what good can certainly be attained, and what evil avoided; and what is quite without the limits of our power: and then how is it blameable if you be carried with a great paſſion to the one and from the other? Do not think all things to be evil which the World calls by that name: nor admire the goodneſs of any thing above its price; nor follow that zealouſly which you are in doubt whether or no it can be attained; and then your paſſions will be ſo far from being your Maſters, that in fear of that you will not refrain to uſe their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And if you ſhould chance to be ſurpriſed with a fancy of ſome evil or good before you can have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to diſcourſe the true nature of it; and your paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions hereby become very ſtrong, and are raiſed to a greater height than you would have them: there is no reaſon to be troubled; for none can prevent theſe ſudden aſſaults, nor can they be quell'd without ſome ſcuffle within. If you can conquer, you have well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted your ſelf. And that will be attended with thoſe triumphs, which will more than recompence the trouble of thoſe furious and rebellious commotions. You will not think thoſe things bad, without which there could not be ſuch a brave and noble thing as Victory is.</p>
               <p>Be content then I beſeech you to be of the race of <hi>Adam,</hi> and do not affect ſome higher Original. Go not about to deſtroy one half of your ſelf, by labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be free from all paſſion. For they that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:101895:199"/>this (as hath been well ſaid by thoſe before us) inſtead of making a good Man, do only raiſe a Statue. In order to make a man wiſe and live in peace, they turn him into a dead and inſenſible Image. Theſe kind of Images (ſay they) are more ſuitable for the ornaments of the Porch, then for the uſes of life. And if we be not blind, we may diſcern between hardneſs and ſoftneſs, a middle temperament, which is called ſolidity and firmneſs.</p>
               <p>The Pilgrim was ſo much pleaſed with theſe words, that he could ſcarce forbear to hugg him when they were ended. And his paſſions having found ſuch a defendor to take their part were ready to ſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves but too much of this friendly diſcourſe in their behalf. I love you infinitely, ſaid he claſping about his neck, or to ſpeak more moderately I love you above all earthly things. There is no Muſick can be ſo charming to me as your words. They can both appeaſe my raging humours, and excite me out of my dull and phlegmatick inclinations. You are my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, my Tutelar Angel, the good Genius of my ſoul, without whom I think I ſhould either have no Paſſions, or Nothing elſe. Go on I beſeech you to oblige me, and to make me if it be poſſible more in love with you. Be not weary of the charge you have undertaken; and do not deſpair neither but in your company I may learn more <hi>diſcretion</hi> to govern thoſe paſſions, which I ſee muſt not be root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out.</p>
               <p>When he had vented this paſſion of love as much as he pleaſed, and was capable to attend to ſome new diſcourſe; the Father thought it not unſeaſonable to
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:101895:200"/>ask him if he did not begin already to repent of all thoſe embraces which he had beſtowed upon him. Nay, do not wonder, purſued he at this demand; for I do not intend to queſtion the greatneſs of your love, but by what I have obſerved I believe you may be afraid that it ought not to be ſo great. I have long taken notice that you are ſo ſcrupulous as not to dare to truſt your own ſoul, nor rely upon the credit of your ſevereſt reaſon. Though you think it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but that there ſhould be ſuch motions as you feel, and know your ſelf to be of ſuch a complexion that if you will love at all it muſt be with a paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateneſs and fervency of affection; yet upon the next ebullition (as I may call it) in your ſoul you are ready to condemn your ſelf and to quit thoſe Maxims of reaſon which you took to be infallible. I know, my friend, that there is in this a pardonable, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commendable niceneſs of ſoul, a delicacy and tenderneſs of conſcience which would not in the leaſt offend God; but it muſt be confeſſed that there is ſomething of weakneſs and unſetledneſs of mind in it alſo, which dare not adhere to its own Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. We are not to let a ſudden fancy ſhake that which is ſo well and rationally eſtabliſhed: Or rather we are to ponder thoſe things ſo long, and to ſettle our ſelves ſo ſtrongly in our reaſons, which are the ballaſt of our ſouls, that we ſhall never deſert them upon the pretence of any pious fears, leſt we ſhould diſpleaſe God. To ſuffer our ſelves to love any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is amiable very much, or put any ſuch like caſe; is it juſtifiable or is it not? If not; away with all theſe Paſſions, and dig them up. But if you will have them remain, be not angry that they grow and bloſſome and bring forth fruit, and produce it in abundance.</p>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:101895:200"/>
               <p>And a little the more to confirm your mind, let me fay ſomething to you of that tenderneſs of affection which I obſerve in you towards a vertuous friend; that inclination which you have to be with him, and eſpecially of that pleaſantneſs and mirth you are apt to yield unto in the company of thoſe you love. You think perhaps that this is too much, and that you take too great a liberty of pleaſing your ſelf. But I beſeech you, did you ever obſerve any great vertue in thoſe cold creatures; or rather in thoſe moroſe and auſtere natures who judge it a crime to love their friends with any paſſion; to feel a joy in their approach; to talk pleaſantly in their company, and to uſe with them a freedom of diſcourſe? Are they more innocent then others, becauſe they ſay Nothing? muſt we let them wear the title of vertue above their neighbours, meerly becauſe they are more grave and ſolemn? Do they live in a greater ſenſe of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they look more ſowrely? Muſt we think there is no piety but what is pale-faced? no mortification of our ſelves, but when our thorns prick other folks? Truly I muſt needs profeſs that I have ſeen both men and women of this rigid humor, whoſe very looks condemn all that is named pleaſure, and will not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford you ſo much as a ſmile, who I am confident are not half ſo harmleſs and innocent as thoſe who profeſs a more open and chearful converſation with their friends. Some of theſe I have obſerved are ſo parſimonious and niggardly, that they are ſordid ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſaving. Others are ſo curſt and peeviſh that they will ſnarl on the leaſt occaſion that croſſes their humor. And you will find few of them who have not theſe two qualities: That they love good chear dearly, and are glad to meet with a Feaſt. Let
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:101895:201"/>a man eat exceſſively, ſo he do it gravely, it is no offence. And ſecondly, that they love to cenſure others, and to paſs harſh judgement upon very inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent actions. Nay, which is moſt villanous, there are ſome of them who will condemn you for that good chear which you beſtowed upon them, and which they themſelves commended in the eating. They will ſay afterward, that you love oſtentation, and that half of it might have been ſpared. They will reprehend this and that as ſuperfluous, and ſay they doubt you are too much affected to the Vanities of the World. Beſides they love to pry into every bodies ſecrets. They would know what is done in all their neighbours houſes: and if it were poſſible they would look into their very Cloſets. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they pretend, they take a ſtrange pleaſure to tattle of theſe things in their own conventicles; and ſome of them would be dumb if they were not provided with ſuch diſcourſe when they meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>But to ſpeak as favourably as may be, I am much inclinable to this opinion, that it is not their wiſdom but their weakneſs which makes them reſerved. They are not ſerious, but only ſowre; not mortified, but moroſe. It is the ſalvageneſs of their Natures which makes them hate all the pleaſantneſs and mirth which others uſe in ſociety. They have not made themſelves of a better habit then their neighbours, but were born with a worſe diſpoſition. They are ſo leaven'd with a ſour humour, that they have no room to entertain any of the ſweet and delightſome paſſions. You think they hate all pleaſures out of Vertue, but it is rather from their temper. It is not their power, but their
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:101895:201"/>inability. They diſtaſte them not becauſe they have a perfection of Judgement, but becauſe they want a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. And therefore they ought not to think better of themſelves, nor be thought ſo by others, meerly becauſe they taſte no joy in that which pleaſes you; for it may proceed from the lumpiſhneſs of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and not from the weight of their reaſons; they may owe it to their parents, and not to their own choice. Or grant that they do deny themſelves in theſe things, yet it is very well if it be not to take a licenſe in thoſe which are Worſe. For many debarr themſelves of innocent mirth, and grant an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to their froward and peeviſh humours. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they be grave, they think they may be diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. And as long as they do not laugh, they will take the liberty to bite.</p>
               <p>I am not you ſee by my complexion inclined much to mirth, and therefore not likely out of any natural humour to be their enemy. But for my part I muſt tell you plainly that I both diſlike and ſuſpect theſe ſullen gravities. The people of a chearful diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are more innocent in thought, more free from deſign, more ſimple and plain hearted, more kind and affectionate, more free from ſuperſtition, and far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from hypocriſie: Nay if I had added that they are more modeſt too, I had not been miſtaken; for their Modeſty is in the heart, and the others often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times but in the brow and exteriour part. But I think, it is time to diſmiſs theſe lowring Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances whom I intend not to reproach, but only to bereave of the opinion and reputation of being own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of more goodneſs then other men. They are to be pittied me thinks who uſe their reaſon to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:101895:202"/>unreaſonable. Who with no ſmall paſſion ſeem to me to ſpeak againſt all our paſſions: and who think well of themſelves for that which is their fault or their imperfection. But whatſoever kindneſs any may have for them, I muſt acknowledge my ſelf to have a Spirit more tender. I am not aſhamed to be thought a man of ſenſe, and that have ſome feeling both of pain and of pleaſure. Let them call if they liſt all our paſſions infirmities, yet (as a wiſe man once ſaid) I rather chooſe to enjoy this weakneſs then their ſtoutneſs and ſtrength, and to be ſick of this diſeaſe, then to have their kind of health.</p>

               <p>IN ſuch diſcourſe as this they paſſed with much pleaſure a long ſtage of their journey. At the end of which, being thirſty, they called at a place where one would think that Heaven deſigned to give the <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim</hi> an example of innocent pleaſure. For here they found a knot of loving neighbours at a frugal din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; who ſeemed to feaſt one another more with their mutual good converſation, then with any other chear that was provided. Their eyes told that they were very merry: and that there was a true love in their hearts, their countenance and free converſe did plainly declare. There was nothing ſuperfluous, but all very handſome; no looſneſs but great great free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:101895:202"/>no noiſe but much innocent pleaſure. They were diſpoſed to Mirth rather then joy; to chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs rather then jollity; and to entertain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a grateful variety rather then abundance of meat and drink. This fight did very much affect the young mans heart, and when they were gone, he began to ſpeak in the praiſe of <hi>Temperance,</hi> and to commend their happineſs who could contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves within the limits of Sobriety. For this ſaid he is the Miſtreſs of health, and alſo of wiſe and pure thoughts. It refreſhes the Body and doth not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the mind. It caſts down neither of them to the ground, but raiſes both to their juſt pitch of pleaſure. It continues us free and fit for any employment, but eſpecially that of thanking God for all his bleſſings, which is the Nobleſt of all. It leaves us capable to enjoy the things of the other world when we have enjoyed as much as we pleaſe of this. It ſuffers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to retain its throne, or rather exalts and advances its Supremacy every day to a greater height. Nay, it preſerves our taſte, and renders our palate more exact then other mens are: for all the ſenſes I perſwade my ſelf when ruled by reaſon, muſt needs be more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Judges, then when that is abſent and ſet aſide.

And when they brag of their Victories they are ſo ſilly as not to remember what one of the Philoſophers ſaith, that they are overcome by the Hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhead which is far more capacious than themſelves. Nay, I cannot but think thoſe people who know no pleaſure but high fare, the joy of whoſe life depends upon full Tables, and as full Bellies, who love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like Feaſts, and would have them as ſumptuous as Sacrifices; to be a ſort of creatures much inferiour to ſome Beaſts; who though they are not capable to govern themſelves, yet are ruled by us, and rendred ſerviceable and profitable to the world.

               <p>No doubt, ſaid the good Father, (who here thought fit to interrupt him) the praiſes which you beſtow upon Temperance are very juſt, and you can never commend it to exceſs.

Their number is very ſmall who are not corrupted with the love of theſe ſenſual pleaſures. Though they do not fall into ſuch high debauches as you ſpeak of, not drinking as if they were in a perpetual feavour, nor eating as if they were laying in proviſion for a long Siege: (which me thinks is a good deſcription which
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:101895:203"/>I have heard ſome give of their exceſs) yet they are not many who meaſure their meals by their needs; and they are not to be told who are Bibbers of Wine, and love to ſit long at compotations, and deſign to make proviſion for the fleſh, that they may fulfil the luſts thereof. Nay, which is ſaddeſt of all, there are too many of thoſe who profeſs to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, whoſe God is their belly. They love Feaſts, and hunt after good chear. And if it be but ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified with a Sermon, Gourmandiſe is innocent in their account. Like ſome naughty Chriſtians in the Elder times whom I mentioned before, who thought they might carouſe and drink as long as they would, ſo they did but ſit with a mortified face upon the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs Tombs. And it were ſome comfort if their ſin ended here; but their Intemperance is the Mother and fruitful Parent of many other Vices. A long train of ſins as well as diſeaſes waits upon this, and follows it juſt at the heels. It both brings in and it uncovers every other evil inclination. It removes that Modeſty, which ſtands more in the way than any thing elſe of moſt mens bad endeavours. It baniſhes all ſhame, ſo that there is nothing left to oppoſe any wickedneſs. Who hath woe, who hath ſorrow, who hath conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who hath babling, who hath wounds without cauſe? They that tarry long at Wine, they that go to ſeek mixt Wine; as the Wiſe man tells us. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever evil diſpoſitions are in the mind, then they take opportunity to ſhew themſelves. Malice is brought into open view, and ſpits its venom. The proud ſpirit is lay'd bare, and ſeeks no pretence for its inſolence. The furious man is left naked of all his guards, and cares not whom he miſchieves. The luſtful man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers himſelf, and ſcarce waits for ſecrecy to fulfil his
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:101895:204"/>deſires. And truly I wiſh I could not ſay that this <hi>Folly</hi> which is the moſt filthy of all, was not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon iſſue of that of which we ſpeak. There is more of this uncleanneſs in the World than you imagine. They that wear the countenance of Religious people are led, I aſſure you, by their Cups to the Brothel-houſes, and paſs from the Taverns to the Stews. So it was of Old, and the ſame Villany continues ſtill; that many <hi>turn the Grace of God into laſeiviouſneſs.</hi> And if you would know who they are, the ſame Apoſtle tells you, that they were ſuch as feaſting with others, did <hi>feed themſelves without fear.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jude 4.12</note> And ſo St. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo lets us know, that <hi>they who accounted it pleaſure to riot in the day-time</hi> (in the clear light of the Goſpel) <hi>had eyes full of adultery,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.13, 14</note> 
                  <hi>and could not ceaſe from ſin.</hi> But I will leave theſe men who are gone in the way of the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Balaam,</hi> who taught the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to commit fornication. Only let me leave thoſe words of the Apoſtle with them;<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.14</note> 
                  <hi>They are Wells without water, Clouds that are carried with a tempeſt, to whom the miſt of darkneſs is reſerved for ever.</hi> Nor will I ſay any more of the reſt of thoſe ſins which attend upon an intemperate life, which makes a mans Soul like a piece of low ground, which by reaſon of abundance of wet, brings forth nothing but Frogs, and Worms, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, all manner of wickedneſs which either diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours God, or hurts our ſelves and our neighbours. I will rather turn my eyes to a more pleaſant ſight, and comfort them with the remembrance of thoſe Good men whom we ſaw juſt now ſo happily met together. And me thinks it is a very great felicity in this falſe World, to find but one face among ſo many Vizors; and to be able to lay hold on ſomething that hath truth and ſubſtance in it among ſo many ſhadows.
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:101895:204"/>Having found therefore a little number of ſeriouſly ſober perſons, it cannot but make me rejoyce the more that Temperance hath ſome Clients, and that ſhe is not forſaken of all her followers.</p>
               <p>But though this be very true, that we do deſervedly praiſe this Vertue and all her Servants; yet me-thinks you ſhould have obſerved ſomething elſe at that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which is worthy of your commendation. Did not the very meeting it ſelf ſeem a very comely ſight? And was you not glad to behold ſo many kind neighbours aſſembled at that decent entertainment? To me there is not a more agreeable ſpectacle than a company of ſelect friends, vacant of buſineſs, and full of chearfulneſs, met together at one table. And I cannot imagine that a man who underſtands pleaſure, can wiſh any equal to this, that he might make one in ſuch an happy ſociety. You may think indeed that it is ſufficient to our delight, if we can meet our friends any where: But I am of the mind that the pleaſure is redoubled when they refreſh their bodies and their minds both together. I hate indeed your great Feaſts; where perſons that never ſaw one the other before, nor ever ſhall perhaps again, are mixt together; where there is much talk, and little or no diſcourſe: But theſe Love-feaſts me-thinks do call to my mind the dayes of Innocence, and make me wiſh for nothing when I enjoy them, but only ſuch another pleaſure. Here we know that we pledge an hearty Love, when a man preſents his kindneſs to us. Our mind is entertained with a greater variety, than the body enjoyes. The very taſte of our meat is exalted by the inward delight which we feel in our hearts. And whatſoever ſatisfaction we then receive, we impart as much to thoſe that give it. The weak and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:101895:205"/>appetite is excited by the ſight of friends, and the pleaſure of their diſcourſe: and the diſcourſe flows more freely by the moderate ſatisfaction of our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite. Our dull ſpirits are raiſed by communication with our friends: and that Communication grows more lively by the exaltation of our ſpirits. Or if you pleaſe ſo to conſider it; Friends never talk with greater wit, and more freedom, than when they take an innocent repaſt together; and their meat never doth their bodies more good, than when this ſweet converſation is the ſauce for it.</p>
               <p>Indeed, ſaid the <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> I had forgot to reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that part of thoſe good mens ſatisfaction: which I take to be ſo great and yet ſo harmleſs withall, that I ſhall ever be a friend of ſuch pleaſures, and permit my ſelf to be merry in ſuch worthy company. They have convinced me that I ought not to affect a ſad brow and an heavy countenance. They have reconciled me to ſmiles and mirth. And provided they will keep within ſuch bounds, I will never quarrel with my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions any more. But there is none that I have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter kindneſs for, than that of Love: the pleaſures of which, as it ſelf acquaints me withall, ſo the uſefulneſs of it thoſe excellent men have alſo taught me.</p>
               <p>And, not to part ſo ſoon from ſo good a meeting, I muſt let you know that they underſtood afterward, a great part of the diſcourſe at that Table was about friendſhip, and the happineſs of him that had found a faithful friend. Which when it was repeated to him by one that was there, it was a great means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming this affection in our Pilgrim, and making him rejoyce in his advantageous choice. My memory is not
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:101895:205"/>ſo good as to carry away all that I heard was ſaid on this argument, but it begun with a commendation of that ſaying of the Son of <hi>Sirach, A faithful friend is a ſtrong defence: and he that hath found ſuch an one,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ecclus. 6 14, 15, 16</note> 
                  <hi>hath found a Treaſure. Nothing doth countervail a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friend, and his excellency is unvaluable. A faithful friend is the Medicine of Life, and they that fear the Lordſhall find him.</hi> He ſpeaks like an Oracle, ſaid one of the company, for a friend me-thinks is the only uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Medicine againſt all the evils of this preſent life. And with your permiſſion I will make a Comment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Aphoriſm; or rather I will recite you the words of a good Author, who, though I believe he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw him, hath gloſſed me-thinks moſt excellently on the Text of that wiſe Hebrew. To which when they had all moſt willingly accorded, he thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is no Remedy in the World, ſaith he,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dion. Pruſ. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>equal to that of a friend; for other Medicines are profitable to the ſick, and ſuperfluous to thoſe who are in health; but He is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to both. He ſupplyes the wants of Poverty. He adds a brightneſs to our glory; and he obſcures and hides our Ignominy. This one things leſſens the difficulty of thoſe that are troubleſome to us; and increaſes the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which all our injoyments bring us. It makes evil things little, and good things great. By this ſweet ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty our griefs are divided, and all our joyes are doubled. What calamity is not intolerable without a friend? and what felicity is not ungrateful if we have none to ſhare with us in it? We ſuffer not ſo much when we have ſome to condole and ſuffer with us: And we rejoyce the more when our felicity gives a pleaſure not only to our ſelves, but to others alſo. If Solitude and want of company be ſo
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:101895:206"/>horrid, ſo dreadful a thing; it is not to be underſtood of the want of men, but of the want of friends. For it is a good Solitude, not to dwell with thoſe that do not love us: and a man would chuſe ſuch an Hermitage where he might not be troubled with them who bear no benevolous affection to him. But for my part I cannot think it to be an happineſs which hath no friend to participate in its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. A man may more eaſily bear the hardeſt Calamity with his Friend, than the greateſt felicity alone. So that</hi> I judge him the moſt miſerable who in his calamity hath many to inſult over him; and in his felicity none to taſte of his joyes, and rejoyce with him. <hi>Who is there more ſpeedy in his ſuccours than a Friend? Whoſe praiſe is ſweeter to us than his? And by whom is Truth ſpoken with leſs grief than by ſuch a mouth? What Caſtle, what Bulwark, what Arms and Weapons, are more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſecure us, than the cuſtody of thoſe who are well-affected to us? For in truth, ſo many Friends as a man hath gained, with ſo many eyes doth he ſee, and with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ears doth he hear, and with ſo many underſtandings doth he think of that which is profitable for him. It is all one as if God had given to a man in one body, a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Souls; every one of which do tenderly conſult and care for his good. Nay, if our eyes, and our tongue, and our hands are much to be prized, not only for the delights of Life, but that we may live; Friends are not only as profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but more neceſſary than theſe. For your eyes can ſcarce ſee thoſe things which are under your feet; but by our Friends we may ſee thoſe things which are in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt parts of the earth. By our eares we hear only the things that are very near us; but by our Friends we hear them which are moſt remote. The tongue ſignifies only to thoſe who are preſent, and with the hands, the ſtrongeſt man can do more than two or three are able: but by
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:101895:206"/>Friends we may talk with all, and be able to effect innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable things; for they will be ſure to ſpeak and do for us all that which is conducible to our good. But that which is moſt incredible is, that when a man hath friends, he may do many things at the ſame time, and conſult about divers affairs at once; and ſee and hear; nay more then that, he may be in many places at the ſame moment. His pleaſures are multiplied, as he multiplies his friends; for all that delights them, touches him with a ſenſe of joy as much as what concerns himſelf. If he give any thing to them, it rejoyces him as much as if he had gained a great deal of Wealth. If he receive any thing, it rejoyces him too, becauſe his friends are pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Though he be very fond of his kindred, yet he thinks friendſhip a greater good, then Conſanguinity; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any kindred between men this is a ſtrict and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble relation; but without this there is no comfort at all in the greateſt nearneſs of blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And therefore we may well conclude with our Wiſe man, that this is the greateſt treaſure, the ſtrongeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, an invaluable Jewel, the very Balſome, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and only preſerver of our life. A man is ſcarce himſelf till he have found a friend, or at leaſt he is but half a man. For as another wiſe man ſaith, Nuptial love produces men, but it is friendly love which gives them perfection. It may well be called the ſalt and ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our Pilgrimage. Without this, life it ſelf would be unſavoury, and all the pleaſures of it inſipid. It is the moſt agreeable pleaſure that a perſon of Vertue can enjoy. It is an holy, chaſte and innocent pleaſure: a Voluptuouſneſs which riſeth higher then ſenſe, and ſeeks the ſuperiour part. It acts on the mind without cauſing it to ſuffer a change. It moves it with ſo much ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:101895:207"/>that it ſtirs not out of its ſeat. Or it raviſhes it from it ſelf, only to remove it to a better place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he had done, they all agreed he did illuſtrate his Author as much as he had done the Son of <hi>Sirach.</hi> For ſaid they, we have read now this Writer by the benefit of your eyes; and you have ſo happily tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported us out of our ſelves, that we find indeed we are better then where we were before. But yet, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another, that Wiſe man you ſpoke of, gives us this advice in the ſame place, <hi>If thou wouldſt get a friend, prove him firſt, and be not haſty to credit him. For ſome man is a friend for his own occaſion, and will not abide in the day of trouble. Some friends will be thy companions at thy table, but in the time of affliction they will not continue. In thy proſperity they will be as thy ſelf, and will be bold over thy ſervants. But if thou be brought low, they will be againſt thee, or hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from thee. Separate thy ſelf from thine enemies, and take heed of thy friends.</hi> How therefore ſhall we know the faithful friend whom he ſo much praiſes; or by what Marks ſhall we diſtinguiſh him from theſe pretenders? I would be loath to ſtay till the day of trouble before I know theſe counterfeit Lovers, and would be glad to impart my joyes to one that deſerves them. It is a very neceſſary Queſtion ſaid a Third, and therefore with your conſent I will undertake his Character, or at leaſt his deſcription. You ſhall not only have our leave, ſaid a fourth in the name of the reſt, but our thanks; which we give you beforehand for ſo good an offer. The world is full of falſe hearted friends. Towns and Kingdoms are made up of theſe honeſt kind of Cheats, as one whom you know is wont to call them. Into whatſoever place you come,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:101895:207"/>you will find very little of that which you have brought hither: I mean affection without intereſt; fidelity without ſtain; with all the goodneſs and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Age of Innocence. There are many, ſaith he, that had rather loſe an hundred Friends, then ſo many Crowns. They value them no more, then they do men in <hi>Turky</hi> that are to be ſold. And I know ſome that would eaſily forgoe their moſt dear and faithful Intimates at the rate of ten or twenty pound a piece. Men they are (if we honour them not too much, with that name) who as the Wiſe Man you ſpoke of ſuggeſts to us, come but to drink, and return back again when the Bottles are empty. And therefore it will oblige us very much if you will be at the pains to let us know the qualities of a man, that is fit to be admitted into our Society.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Friend then, replyed he, that is worthy of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome love, is a perſon that is equally good and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent: That can neither deceive, nor eaſily be deceived: that can ſeldome do ill out of weakneſs, and never out of deſign. He is one that will ſerve you without Vanity, but with all imaginable zeal: without any intereſt, but with the exacteſt care and diligence. That will engage himſelf moſt paſſionately in your defence when you are abſent, or unfortunate, or dead. That will follow you with his love to the other World; and ſerve thoſe when you are dead, whom you would have ſerved if you had been alive. He is one that never conceals his own ſecret from you, nor reveals yours to others. That will freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove you, and never back-bite other men. That can ſee your faults, and yet eaſily pardon them. And that as readily acknowledges merit, as he eſpies and pardons faults. That cannot tell how to do any thing without
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:101895:208"/>your knowledge, unleſs it be a good turn. That would have you ſee all he doth, except the friendly offices which he is every where rendring to you. That loves to entertain you with pleaſant diſcourſe, but howſoever with wholeſome and profitable. That will follow you to all dangers, though to no ſins. That can vary perhaps with your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, but not with your fortune. That can make you a feaſt where there is no good chear beſides himſelf. That can ſerve as ſauce to excite your appetite, and ſave you the charge of Wine to exhilarate your ſpirits. That will divert you, without the prejudice or offence of any body elſe. That will make you more ſenſible of his tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by ſmall things, then others can do by greater ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He is one that thinks all the praiſes of others importune if you complain. To whom even his own merit ſeems odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, if it receive not your approbation. One that loves no pleaſure ſo much as complacence to you. To whom all places are alike, ſo you be not abſent. He can deny himſelf any thing and his friend nothing. He can bear himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in Solitude, but is never weary of the company of thoſe he loves. He hath a ſenſe of honour, equal to his ſenſe of love. He hath no vulgar thoughts, but yet ſtoops to the moſt vulgar actions for the ſervice of his friend. He hath a great and generous mind, but omits not the trifles which will pleaſe him. He will neglect his own buſineſs to do his. He will receive a kindneſs as well as do it: and is not more willing to oblige than to be obliged. He is thankful and acknowledging for the ſmalleſt offices of love; and studies to repay it with the greateſt. He is poſſeſſed of all the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, but makes a ſhow of none. He loves decency without affectation, generoſity without pride, courteſie without ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, and strictneſs without ſeverity. His morality is
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:101895:208"/>void of all rudeneſs; his ſeriouſneſs gives no diſguſt; his ſilence is without ſullenneſs; and his humility without baſeneſs and meanneſs of ſpirit. He hath a World of good qualities, and modeſty is Superior to them all. For he is ſhamefac'd without ignorance, and bluſhes becauſe you ſee he knows ſo much. He delights not to praiſe that in others wherein he excells himſelf. Nor is he ſparing there of his commendations, where his own defects will leave him no title to the application. He can hide any thing better then his love. He can do any thing better then deny your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. He can endure any thing with more eaſe then to be ſeparated from your Society. When you are with him, you are ſtill alone. When you adviſe with him it is with your ſelf. He hath all things in common with you, but chiefly adverſity. He and his friend have but one will; though they may have different underſtandings. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this one quality is it which I like in a friend above all the reſt,</hi> viz. <hi>A ſweet and innocent compliance, which is the cement of love and the ſecret charm of Society. This rare diſpoſition makes him to pleaſe us without flattery: and to tye himſelf to us without the loſs of liberty. If ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords to our deſires without oppoſing reaſon: gives way to our weakneſs without increaſing and cheriſhing of it: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodates it ſelf to our humour under the generous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of freedom; ſerves us in all things it can, without being captivated to any. There is nothing baſer indeed then compliance when it is ſeparated from other Vertues. Nothing more offenſive to thoſe on whom it is beſtowed if they have any noble reſentments in them; then when it is ſo ſervile as to ſubject the underſtanding and enthrall the reaſon to their deſires. But being to attend upon thoſe other good qualities which I have required in my friend, and ſerving alwayes with a liberty of mind; as there is nothing leſs offends any body elſe, ſo nothing more ſweetens
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:101895:209"/>a mans own diſpoſition, or more delights and gratifies that of his friends. It bends it ſelf to profit others and not only to pleaſe. It ſtudies to advantage them with the greateſt civility. It ſubdues their paſſions with the greateſt quietneſs. It reduces them to themſelves without violence. It ſtoops unto them that it may lift them up. It conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends that they may be recovered. It faſhions it ſelf to what they are, that they may be what they ought. It yields to their anger that it may diſarm them of it. It grants their deſires that it may take them away. It makes a man agree to others not that they may comply with him again, but comply with reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In ſhort therefore, he muſt be a vertuous perſon, we all grant, whom we chuſe for our friend. For he is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be a friend to us, who is not a friend to himſelf. He can never accord well with another, who feels an inteſtine war continually in his own breaſt. But yet all vertuous perſons do not ſo reſemble each the other, as to joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that ſtrict <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion which bears the name of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: And therefore he is fit to be received into this rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion who beſides the qualities common to all good men, doth Symbolize with us in his humors and inclinations. When you meet with ſuch a man as anſwers this deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, make much of him and place a great confidence in him. To diſtruſt him is the higheſt ſin you can commit againſt him. To be ſuſpicious of the truth of what he ſaith is the moſt notorious breach of the bond of your friendſhip. And as ſoon as ever you begin to doubt, it is certain you begin leſs to love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this effect was the diſcourſe of him who took upon him to give the deſcription of a worthy friend: which was highly applauded by the whole Table and
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:101895:209"/>ſerved for an excellent cloſe of their feaſt. And truly the repetition of it made a new feaſt for our Pilgrim who began upon this occaſion to reflect on his own happineſs who had met with a friend that anſwered in all points this great Character to the very life. O Sir, ſaid he to the Father, what a loſs am I at for words to expreſs my felicity who have found the beſt of men and the beſt of friends! How gladly would they have admitted you into that loving Society from which we lately parted! They would have raviſhed you from me and ſtaid you there for ever if they had known your worth. They would have thought it too much that I ſhould encloſe ſo great a good, which is capable to ſerve a little World. For beſides the reſt of thoſe vertuous qualities which they remembred, you are the moſt compaſſionate of all men living. You cannot be merry I ſee, if I be ſad. The leaſt grief which I ſuffer penetrates to the bottom of your heart. And if I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not I touch upon a truth of the greateſt remark to diſtinguiſh a ſleight from a ſubſtantial friend. For I have heard wiſer men then my ſelf note, that the World hath no great number of thoſe people, who are deeply wounded with the ſenſe of the miſery that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls their friends; or whoſe reſentments of ſorrow are of any long durance, though they be never ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately moved with the firſt ſight or report of them. Compaſſionate grief they obſerve, is wont ſoon to ſlide away; and make room for the entrance of any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Moſt men can divert themſelves delightfully if occaſion ſerve; though their friends ſufferings be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſad. They have not made their concernments ſo much their own, as that they ſhould feel pain as long as their friends. But yet I find you to be one of that little number who are infinitely tender, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:101895:210"/>touched with all the infirmities of thoſe that they love. How often have you charged your ſelf with my cares and diſquiets? How many thorns have you drawn out of my mind? How many expedients have you deviſed to ſuccour and ſupport me under all my burdens? You have often tempered the heat of my paſſions. You have ſweetned the ſharpneſs of my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. You have healed my wounds when you could not prevent the blow. You have brought me cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, when I was capable of no conſolations but thoſe which your company adminiſtred to me. You have devided with me the labours which I am to undergo. And taken a part of that duty upon you which I am to perform. And have made your ſelf ſo inſeparable to me, as if it was but one life which you and I lived. I ought to value you as much as my ſelf; and for as much as my perſon is dearer to me then all my world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goods; I ought to eſteem the benefits you have done my mind, more then if you had given me a maſs of treaſure, and poſſeſſed me of the faireſt eſtate which the eye of the World hath ever ſeen.</p>

               <head type="sub">How they chanced to ſee a very Poor man entertaining himſelf with much pleaſure under a Tree. Whence aroſe a diſcourſe of Contentment: and the means to attain it. Of <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> That notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all our <hi>Charity,</hi> we muſt not think to have the World ſo good as we would wiſh it.</head>
               <p>I Know not to what length he meant to continue theſe acknowledgments, if a new accident had not put an end to his ſpeech. For as he was going to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll the nobleneſs of his diſpoſition, as well as the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs which he obſerved; and had juſt uttered theſe words, you ſcarce know how to keep a meaſure when there is occaſion to be kind; your favours ſeem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective unleſs they exceed: they were on a ſudden en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with another delighful ſpectacle which quite diverted his thoughts from what he was about to ſay. For as they paſſed by a fair field they eſpied a poor man in very ragged clothes under a large Beach Tree who was liſtning to the Muſick which the Birds made in the neighbouring grove, and ſometimes whiſtled himſelf to bear them company in their melodies. A long time they ſaw him thus entertain himſelf, and at laſt he pull'd out a piece of bread and cheeſe, which with eyes lifted up to Heaven he ſeem'd to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a liberal dinner. And at the end of it he went and pledged the Birds in a little ſtream that ran by him, giving God thanks again that had provided food for all his Creatures. They were much taken with the innocence of his looks and the contentment which
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:101895:211"/>they thought they read in his face, which bred a great deſire in them to know him better and ſee ſomething more of a Vertue hid under rags. And ſo approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nearer to him and giving him the ordinary ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the time of the day required, they entred into diſcourſe, and in concluſion enquired of his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and how he came to lead ſo merry a life being in appearance ſo deſtitute and low in his Worldly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. The poor man made no ſcruple to diſcover his heart to them; but being of a free and open diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and not caring who was privy to his thoughts moſt readily accorded to anſwer their deſires. And he plainly told them that the occaſion of the preſent ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction which perhaps they ſaw him expreſs, was to hear the Birds ſo merry; who neither ſow, nor reap, nor have any barns wherein to lay up their food. I could not chuſe, ſaid he, but bear a part with them in their Mirth, and think my ſelf at leaſt as rich and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as thoſe ſilly creatures. The World I ſee is as full for me as it is for them. All places are crowded with the bleſſings of God, and I know not where he ſhould beſtow more, they are ſo very full. A few of them alſo will ſerve my turn, for my wants are but a few. And a few things ſure are eaſily obtained, and cannot be long in getting. We need not go far to ſeek enough; for there is no ſcarcity of a little, and a little will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And thanks be to God I was never yet at any great trouble to procure this little number of neceſſary things. At preſent my wants are all ſupplyed; and I have no reaſon to doubt but they will be ſo for the time to come. For ſure there is a God; and he muſt needs take care of his Creatures: and I imagine it is no pride (which will not become me in this Poverty) to think my ſelf one of the better ſort; and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:101895:211"/>that I ſhall not want. There is nothing ſo much comforts me as the thoughts of his Fulneſs, of his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, of his Goodneſs, Power and Preſence to all places, which make me confident that at preſent I enjoy what is moſt convenient for me, and that I ſhall never fail to do the like through all my life. And if I doubted of any of theſe, that inſtance of his Love and Care in ſending his own Son into the World would rid me of all my ſcruples. <hi>For if he ſpared not his Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him give us all things.</hi> For the comforts of this belief I continually render my thanks to God; and you cannot conceive any greater contentment than that which I find in admiring and praiſing his eternal Goodneſs. Nay, I can never me-thinks give him thanks enough for letting me enjoy the uſe of my eyes, my tongue, my hands and feet; for theſe are greater things than all that I want, and by theſe and his bleſſing I may make proviſion for my wants. There are many I ſee in the World are poorer by half than my ſelf. I poſſeſs ſo much more than they, as all thoſe things which I have now numbred. O how rich do I eſteem my ſelf in compare with the blind, and the dumb, and the lame! But I ſhould be much aſhamed if among all thoſe who have leſs than I, there ſhould be found men that have more content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And I conſider with my ſelf ſometimes; ſhould thoſe poor Souls murmure, what is it that I ſhould ſay to give them content; and that very thing I ſay to my ſelf. I make the experiment firſt upon my own mind, and if it can do nothing there to comfort me who am in better condition, I think it unreaſonable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it unto them. And ſometimes on the other ſide I caſt mine eyes on them that have more, and ſee that they are as far from content as thoſe who have nothing
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:101895:212"/>at all: from whence I conclude that it is not to be found in all the World, but in our ſelves, and there I may find it without the abundance that they enjoy. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive alſo that Poverty is not without its benefits, and that it is deſervedly called the Mother of Sobriety, the Nurſe of Arts, the Miſtreſs of Wiſdom, the Spur to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and the School to which we are put to learn the Knowledge of our ſelves, and the dependence we have on an higher Cauſe. Beſide all which, I uſe to call it my Sanctuary which no body will preſume to rifle. Here I am ſafe, for all men hate to hurt the poor. There is no Antidote of greater vertue, as I have heard men ſay againſt poiſon, than this condition wherein I am. They are the Veſſels of Gold, and not of Earth and Wood, wherein ſuch deadly potions are wont to be mingled. Nay, this Muſick which you ſaw me liſſening to, this Muſick of Gods own creating gives me the greater raviſhment, becauſe I conſider that none can rob me of it, and leave me my liberty and life. They that have taken away my goods, and have baniſhed me into the Woods, cannot hinder the Earth from putting forth the Flowers, nor the Trees from yielding their fruit, nor the Birds from ſinging among the branches; no nor me from entertaining my ſelf with all theſe pleaſures, at leaſt from being contented. And truly I ought me-thinks to rejoyce that theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions are remaining, rather than repine that thoſe are gone which could never have given me full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. But I ſuppoſe I ſpeak to thoſe who are not unacquainted with ſome wants, and therefore I may forbear to ſay any more than this; that if you can tell what it is that keeps you from being miſerable, that very thing is the comfort of my Poverty. For he that can reſt contented in one condition, can ſatisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:101895:212"/>in all: and he who is not pleaſed in his preſent ſtate, will alwayes find ſome matter of complaint.</p>
               <p>Our young <hi>Pilgrim</hi> would fain have had him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in declaring the ſenſe of his Soul to them, becauſe he took him to be ſo happy. But yet he could not chuſe but yield to the equity of that which he had now ſaid, and therefore after they had requited the Poor mans generous freedom with a long diſcourſe, which both teſtified their ſympathy with him, and added much to the contentment of his mind; He entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a debate with the Father when they were alone about thoſe things which will prepare the Soul to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſatisfaction in the meaneſt condition into which they might fall. For my part, ſaid he, I cannot but look back upon the felicity of thoſe who lead a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate life in the midſt of all the abundance of this World. Every thing lets me ſee the neceſſity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of that Vertue, and gives me occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new my commendations of it. The moderate uſe of all pleaſant things doth moſt effectually teach content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe it ſhews us how little will ſerve our turn. It weans us alſo from the love of ſenſual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, which is the only thing that makes the want or the loſs of them ſo troubleſome unto us. It makes room for wiſe and ſober thoughts. And me-thinks is nothing elſe but a conſtant exerciſe of contentment in one particular, which muſt needs diſpoſe our minds to the practice of all other parts of it. It is no great matter to be debarred of that, which we have oft for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to our ſelves: There is nothing taken away but what we could ſpare. We want nothing, but what we could want, while we were poſſeſſed of it. We are not forced to be without theſe things, for we
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:101895:213"/>choſe before to enjoy but a little of them. This is to praeoccupate and foreſtall the blows of fortune, as the Heathens I have heard were wont to ſay, when they ſpoke of the changes that we ſuffer in the World. We are before-hand by this means with any alteration. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can give us any wound that ſhall make us ſmart, becauſe we have felt the point of it already. We have made a tryal of its power, and know what want can do upon us. We may cry out, as a generous Soul once did; I have got before thee, whatſoever Neceſſity thou art that intendeſt to come upon me. I have taken thee, and hold thee faſt in my hands. I have intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all thy aſſaults, and thou canſt not touch my heart. Nothing can arrive, but what is here before. I know the worſt of all things, for I have inured my ſelf to bear them.</p>
               <p>You are in the right, replyed the Father, and I thank you for this good reflection. They do very ill ſure, who deſire to lead a contented life, and yet uſe themſelves to fare delitiouſly every day. They forget what is a coming who love to ſwim in pleaſures, and to gulp down as much as they are able of theſe ſenſual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. They are but preparing their own priſons, and twiſting the whips that muſt ſcourge themſelves. They do but make themſelves more tender, and apt to ſhrink at the prick of a Pin. They will cry out moſt bitterly under thoſe laſhes, which ſober men will ſcarce feel. And yet let me tell you, that you would have done well to have caſt your eyes a little further back to ſome things of which we have not ſo lately ſpoken. You carry your contentment about you continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and it lyes in a little room; if you have not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the very firſt Leſſon which I taught you at your
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:101895:213"/>ſetting out. Theſe few words, <hi>I am nought, I have nought, I deſire nought but Jeſus and Jeruſalem,</hi> I told you were like a little Bottle of Eſſences, which a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller muſt alwayes have in his pocket, and of which if he do but take a ſip, he will inſtantly find relief in any condition of life. <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> I mean are ſufficient to carry us thorow this evil World with an equal and well-poiſed mind. For as for the firſt of them; what is it, but the ſubmiſſion of our wills in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to God, which is the very ſecret of Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? It is a great ſenſe of his Supreme Authority over us, with which it is a folly to diſpute; and of his Supreme Wiſdom and Goodneſs, out of whoſe hands it is a folly, if we might, to take our ſelves. It makes us think that we deſerve nothing at all, and ſo to be well-pleaſed that we have not leſs than we enjoy. It teaches us to renounce our own underſtandings, and to think that beſt, which is ſo in Gods account. But I will not take a great deal of pains in an eaſie argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore let us only conſider what the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is, that no man is ſatisfied with the portion which Providence hath allotted to him: From the greateſt to the meaneſt we ſee, that men are ever complaining of their fortune. It is in vain that Heaven beſtows many bleſſings upon them, for they turn all into gall and bitterneſs, and have ſomething within which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes all their happineſs. The taſte of what they have is ſpoiled, by a perpetual thirſt after ſomething or other which they want. But might they not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy themſelves well enough without it? There is no queſtion to be made of it. For otherwiſe he that hath given them greater things, would not permit them to be without the leſs. <hi>The Life is more than meat, and the Body than rayment.</hi> What is the reaſon then that
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:101895:214"/>they deſire that ſo paſſionately of which they have no real need, and never take any comfort in that which they cannot be without? Truly I can find none, ſave only this, that though they do not need many things to their happineſs, yet in the opinion of the World they do, and it will not account them happy without them. The World thinks him no body who does not wear fine Cloaths, who hath not a great Eſtate, who is not able to leave his children very rich, who cannot revenge himſelf on his enemies, and have a large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over others, though he can command himſelf never ſo much: And ſo they ſacrifice their own eaſe to the popular opinions. They vainly employ their time to ſatisfie other men, rather than themſelves. They conſider more what will be ſaid of them if they be not in ſuch or ſuch an eſtate, than they do their own quiet and repoſe. And is it poſſible can we think that a man ſhould be well-pleaſed, who refuſing to comply with reaſon alone, deſires to give content to that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Chimaera called <hi>Opinion?</hi> It cannot be; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince it is the Opinion of others, and not his own only which he follows; and this is a thing ſo infinite, and withall ſo mutable and uncertain, that it will never give him any reſt who is led by it. But then after all this, let us conſider what it is that makes men deſirous to content the World, in order to content themſelves. Is it not their Pride and deſire to be eſteemed? Is it not a vain ſtudy to be admired, and to have a great Name in the World? Let us be <hi>Humble</hi> then and we ſhall be contented. Let us have a mean eſteem of our ſelves, and we ſhall not be troubled that other mens thoughts are conformable to our own. Let us think we have more than we deſerve, and we ſhall at the moſt but ſtudy to be worthy ſtill to have it. Let us
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:101895:214"/>thus endeavour to make our ſelves happy, and we ſhall not care whether other men think us happy or no.</p>
               <p>And then for <hi>Charity</hi> or the Love of God, it hath this particular Charm, that it renders all conditions alike agreeable unto us, becauſe we never conſider any thing therein, but only him alone. When we are ſo full of him as to love him with all our heart, and all our ſoul, and all our ſtrength, there can be but little room for any thing elſe. Some troubleſome thoughts may intrude themſelves, but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dwell in us, becauſe the love of him will thruſt them out. Beſides the love of him is very powerful to beget in our ſouls a perſwaſion that he loveth us. Our Love is but the product of his; and there is nothing more comfortable then to think that we are beloved of ſo great a Good. And then again, Love is apt to make us well pleaſed with all that they do whom we entirely love. We can take nothing ill at their hands, but alwayes perſwade our ſelves that they mean well. It pleaſes us much that they ſhould pleaſe themſelves. And therefore if we love God, it will produce the ſame ſatisfaction in all his Providences: we ſhall love them every one, becauſe we are in love with him. Eſpecially ſince we are ſatisfied by this love of his good affection to us; it will not let us ſuſpect him of any unkindneſs. We ſhall alwayes reſt aſſured of his good will, and ſo have no more to ſay but only this, <hi>Thy will, O Love, be done.</hi> And I may add alſo that the Love of God being juſt oppoſite to our ſelf-love which is the root of all our troubles, muſt needs be the foundation and root of all our contentment. For what is Contentment, but the ſtability, as it were,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:101895:215"/>of the Soul whereby it ſtands in one unmoveable temper? It is a kind of indifferency, an unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in all things but only God. And how is that to be purchaſed, but only by ſuch a ſtrong affection to him as deſtroyes the inordinate love of our ſelves and all other things. As long as that love of our ſelves reigns, it carries us headlong to every thing that pleaſes our carnal appetites. It make us range up and down the World after every trifle that we have a fancy unto. It makes us vex if we be croſſed in the leaſt of our deſires. It ſets us in a reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs motion without any poſſibility of ever fixing our ſelves. It makes us as paſſionately concern our ſelves for a toy as if it touched our very life. And therefore till this be deſtroyed, we are not likely to find the contentment which we ſeek. Now the Love of God, that is juſt contrary to it and cannot ſtand together with it. That concenters and unites all our thoughts and affections in one Good which we may alwayes have and in which we may alwayes have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. That ſettles our ſouls in one place, out of which we need not ſtir to ſeek our happineſs. That carries our hearts continually above and ſets us out of the reach of theſe worldly things. It raiſes us beyond our ſelves and makes us feel him who is infinitely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: who alſo we know rules and diſpoſes all things in the world, according to that excellent goodneſs which we feel in him. Let us love him therefore now as much as we can, and in this let us place our happineſs. So ſhall we never fail to be well pleaſed; becauſe every thing will make us more to love him.</p>
               <p>I thank you moſt heartily, ſaid the Pilgrim, for the ſeaſonable remembrance you have given me of
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:101895:215"/>that excellent leſſon. It hath done me ſo much good, that I cannot ſee how any thing ſhould trouble me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be this; to ſee ſo little Love of God in the world, and that I can do no more good upon men whom I love for Gods ſake. It is very well, replyed the Father, if you have no more to trouble you then this; for it is only the fruit of a great Love, which ſometime is wont to make us ſick, if it meet with unkind enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment in thoſe on whom it is beſtowed. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides let me tell you this for your better ſatisfaction; that you muſt content your ſelf to ſee the world ſo imperfect as it is. You will never have any quiet, if you vex your ſelf becauſe you cannot bring mankind to that exact <hi>Idaea</hi> of things which you have formed in your mind. You deſire, I perceive, above all things that there might be peace on earth, and that Chriſtian people might live in a ſweet agreement to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But be not Ignorant I pray you of this, that you do but trouble your ſelf, and the world too, if you think to attain this happineſs by making all ſo perfect as your ſelf. As it is too commonly ſeen that Good men hinder peace by inſiſting over vehemently upon leſſer truths, which might well ſtand aſide to make way for unity in greater things: ſo an unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and violent indeavour to correct ſome faults, and root out ſome abuſes, and to take away ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect inſtitutions hath too frequently driven peace away from the Church of God. All which proceeds from want of prudence and diſcreet conſideration of things, with which an honeſt and well meaning zeal had need to be tempered. We muſt well weigh the nature and moment of things. When it is impoſſible to have all we honeſtly deſire, we muſt take what we can, rather then want the chiefeſt thing that is in our
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:101895:216"/>deſires. We do not live in a world that is compoſed of complete Chriſtians. All is weak, all is ſick and diſtempered in the Societies of men. They are in a ſtate of great infirmity, not to ſay corruption and degeneracy. He that would go about preſently to make all ſo healthy and pure, ſo free from all diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as he deſires; hath much piety perhaps, but little prudence. He conſiders not that a crazy ſtate of things, cannot be ſo ſoon amended and reſtored to entire ſoundneſs. We ſhall ſooner kill then work a Cure, if we apply ſuch violent Medicines, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly make uſe of the higheſt remedies. We muſt deal gently with Patients that are very ſick and alſo labour of a Chronick diſeaſe. We muſt wait for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable ſeaſons; we muſt try what they can bear; we muſt go on by ſteps and degrees to extirpate a long ſettled and inveterate ill habit of mind. In plain words we muſt not expect and ſtay, as I told you, for peace in our ſelves or the world either, till all men be as good as we would have them. We muſt not remain in Confuſion, till we can eſtabliſh ſuch an exact plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and model of things as Piety teaches us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. We muſt conſider whether it can be attained in this ſtate of affairs. We muſt obſerve what the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world is able to endure. We muſt do as Workmen and Artificers are wont, who when they have not the choice of their Materials out of which they are to frame a piece, do content themſelves to form ſuch an one as their Stuff will yield. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible out of bad matter to form a compleat and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent piece of Work. And this doth not argue the defect of the Artificer, but the incapacity of that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he exerciſes his skill. It is the knotty logg and not he which renders the Statue ſo mean. Such
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:101895:216"/>defects and imperfections in the Body of mankind, nay and of Chriſtians alſo, we muſt be forced to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate our ſelves unto; or elſe we muſt break So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and not be one Body. Neither God nor man will expect that we ſhould make things perfect, where the ſtate of men is capable of Nothing but imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He himſelf was fain to comply with the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate hardneſs of the Carnal Jews. The Laws which he gave were not the beſt, but ſuch as they could bear. And truly we muſt all be content to ſuffer that which we cannot mend. Patience muſt be the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of thoſe things which cannot be corrected. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that Chriſtianity be not deſtroyed, nor Juſtice and Piety ſubverted, we muſt for peace ſake tolerate many faults, till <hi>they</hi> can be taken away and leave <hi>it</hi> ſtill remaining. There are ſome things that are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, and others only excellent and very deſireable. Some that are indiſpenſable and others that may be let alone. Some that muſt exerciſe our zeal, and others only our Patience. And we had need pray to God that all may be ſo happy as rightly to diſtinguiſh theſe. That they may have as much light as they have heat. That good affection may not be ſparated from good underſtanding. That the the more piety any man hath, the more prudence and wiſdom he may be adorned withall. So will he not only keep peace, but alſo make it. He will not be a <hi>Friend,</hi> but alſo a <hi>Father</hi> of it. And in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood obtain that by ſoft and moderate courſes; which the more Violent, though ſeemingly more Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous too, will certainly drive away.</p>
               <p>It is poſſible indeed the World may call this a luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm temper: but do not regard at all what they ſay.
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:101895:217"/>For as <hi>Charity</hi> teaches you to be thus moderate; So from <hi>Humility</hi> you learn not to matter their cenſures of you for it. You ſhall never be at any quiet, if you be troubled at all that men are pleaſed to talk of your doings. Or if their good eſteem be neceſſary to your content, it is a very eaſie matter to foretell that you ſhall alwayes live without it. Thoſe are excellent ſayings me-thinks which our Fore-fathers have left behind them. <hi>He ſhall have enough to do who studies to pleaſe fools and them that have no skill. To pleaſe and to diſpleaſe are the meer effects of chance and hazzard; wiſdom and ſufficiency have no ſhare therein. Two things deſerve to have but little credit given to them; the eſteem of great men, and the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the people. Reputation is a thing that is often got without merit; and loſt without any ill deſervings.</hi> And therefore when we have won the greateſt ſhare of mens good Opinion, why ſhould we think our ſelves the better? And when we have loſt it again, what cauſe is there to judge our ſelves the worſe? Are you the taller in the evening becauſe your ſhaddow is lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or are you ſhorter at noon becauſe it is then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted? Do not think of your ſelf then according to the meaſure of the Honour you receive from others; for it is at the beſt but the ſhadow of Vertue. So you know it is vulgarly called; and if you allow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, there is more of inſtruction in it, then you may imagine. The ſhadow you know attends the body whereſoever it goes: It is its inſeparable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and will nto be parted from it. And ſo truly doth honour and glory wait upon all Vertuous actions. Though no body commend them, yet they commend themſelves. A man cannot but think he hath done bravely, though there be none to applaud him but his
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:101895:217"/>own conſcience of what he hath done. And therefore regard not ſo much what the World thinks of you, as what you think of your ſelf. Ask not whether it be ſatisfied, but whether you have rendred Juſtice to your own reſolutions. Wait not to receive commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations from abroad, but think it ſufficient if you meet with no reproaches at home. Not that I would have you refuſe juſt praiſes when they are beſtowed upon you, much leſs think it is the ſtile of Saints to be talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your vileneſs. But I would only have you to do well though you hear ill; and only to learn to do better if you meet with good acceptance. For the truth is, the approbation of wiſe men though it ſhould not puff us up, yet it ought to encourage us. And he that rejects all the teſtimony of others, doth not ſo much expreſs the Vile opinion he hath of himſelf, as the contempt wherein he holds his Neighbours.</p>

Which cauſing them to turn their eyes back, a proper man well mounted preſented himſelf to them, iſſuing out of another rode upon the left hand and falling then into that wherein they were. When he was come up and had joyned himſelf to them; he aſkt preſently the common Queſtion, Whither travel you? They were not ſhy of making him a true an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:101895:218"/>but told him that they were going to a place called <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> You are well overtaken then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed he, for that is the deſign of my journey alſo, and I ſhall be very glad of your company. But I muſt tell you, that if you have ſtill held this rode, you are very much out of your way or elſe all my knowledge fails me. For it lyes a great deal more on this hand (point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the left) and here we muſt now turn again and leave this wherein I find you, unleſs we mean to miſs of our aim and be lead to ſome other place. Let me be your Guide if you pleaſe, for I am ſo well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the way that it is impoſſible for me to miſtake it. You may truſt me; for I am confident though I ſhould ſhut mine eyes or go hoodwinkt thither I ſhould not miſlead you.</p>
               <p>He ſpoke very gracefully and was witty in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, excellent company alſo by reaſon of his pleaſant humour, and withall of a carriage very civil and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting. But they obſerved that he had a ſword by his ſide and a pair of Piſtols before him, together with another Inſtrument hanging at his Belt which was formed for pulling out of eyes. This they thought was none of a Pilgrims habit, and they viewed him ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully that they concluded he was one of that Brood who if they cannot perſwade Travellers into their way, will drive them into it, and then carry them blindfold for fear they ſhould forſake it. Whereupon the Father ſaid to him, Sir, do not think me rude if I be ſo plain with you, as to ſpeak in the ſtile of our uſual Proverb and let you know, that we had rather have your room then your company. We are ſtrongly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed againſt thoſe who would make us believe we cannot ſee our way, unleſs we let them pull out our
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:101895:218"/>eyes. Nor will you ever be able to invent ſo many good words as to reconcile us to them; who when they find men in courſes contrary to their own, are not content to labour by reaſon to bring them to their bent, but ſhoot them to death if they ſtifly refuſe, as if they were but rogues and theeves. And you will have a great deal to do to perſwade us that you are not one of that number. We ſee what weapons you are provided of, and we ſhall never be convinced that they are innocent. We dread you more then the <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti</hi> and all the lawleſs men in the World. We had rather fall into the hands of Turks and Barbarians, then live under your Tyranny. For though they ſtrip us of our clothes and ſpoil our goods; yet they will leave us our ſenſes and our reaſons of which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to bereave us. We may believe our eyes; and truſt our feeling and our taſt in their Country; but in yours they have loſt their credit and are deprived of their uſe in matters of the greateſt concernment. And therefore I wonder you are ſo confident of the way wherein you would guide us, ſince your eyes do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes report things truly to you. You ſhall not ſee for us, ſince you acknowledge your ſight ſo deficient. We can be ſure of nothing if ſuch as you be our infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers. Perhaps there is no ſuch perſon as <hi>Jeſus</hi> whom we ſeek, or he is a ſleep in his grave and we ſhall never ſee him at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> For though there are that have told us they ſaw him and handled him after he roſe again, by what means will you aſſure us that it was not an illuſion? Our hands and eyes may deceive us you ſay in other caſes, and therefore what priviledge had theirs from being cheated? But beſides, as I was going to ſay at the firſt, if you are ſo certain of your way as you pretend, I beſeech you why do you
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:101895:219"/>not make it good by better arguments, than thoſe that are made of Steel? Why cannot you illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate us without caſting us into the midſt of a fire? who more likely to be wrong, than they who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident they are in the right, and cannot prove it? It is a great ſign you intend to couzen us, becauſe you will not let us examine your Ware. Since you vend it in a dark ſhop, where no body can ſee it, we hold it in great ſuſpition of being nought. But if we do not like it, why will you not ſuffer us to let it alone? Why muſt we be forced to buy, or elſe pay for our refuſal with the price of our lives? Is this the way to make Chriſtians, never to conſider that they are men? Is this the mark of being filled with the Holy Ghoſt, to breathe forth nothing but threatnings and ſlaughters? Me-thinks you transform the Heavenly Dove into the ſhape of a Vulture or a Raven. We have heard of her ſweet nature, of her ſighs and mournings, but we are ſtrangers to her fierceneſs, and know nothing of her croaking for a prey. To give her claws, and arm her with talons and a bloody beak, what is it but to turn her into a Monſter? I cannot conceive, ſaith one of your own neighbours, but more ingenious than the reſt, that they ſhould be the Chriſtian Paſtors who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Butchers of the Flock: and that the Church which was for ſo many Ages in great perſecution, ſhould now it ſelf begin to perſecute. Or if you reckon us for thoſe creatures that are without the fold, then we are ſure to be worried by you. Though the Church be never ſo loving a Mother to you, yet ſhe hath no kindneſs at all for ſtrangers. You tell us indeed that ſhe opens her arms to us, but we doubt that it is to preſs us to death. Nay, Her breaſts we ſee do feed you with Blood, and not with Milk. Her children
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:101895:219"/>are cruel and ravenous, and therefore what would you have us to judge of her ſelf?</p>
               <p>The Gentleman who ſeemed all the time to be much troubled at this diſcourſe, here interrupted it, and told him that he was too vehement; proteſting that he had no deſign to do them any hurt. We are as innocent people, continued he, as any in all the World, and if you would let us travel together, I would bring you to more good company, who ſhall give you all the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance imaginable of our harmleſs intentions. Do but tell what ſecurity you deſire, and I will undertake it ſhall not be refuſed. I know them all ſo well, that I dare engage my Soul for their fidelity to their word. Undertake nothing, I beſeech you, replyed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for other folks. If you had engaged that pawn only for your ſelf it might be taken, becauſe you ſeem a Gentleman, and a perſon of good nature: but as for the moſt of your company, they can never give me the aſſurance which I ſhall deſire. There is but one ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which I can confide in, and that is the ſame which the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> demanded of one who offered to ſeal him his faithful Friendſhip; <hi>viz. That if they have any will to do us any miſchief, they ſhall never have any power.</hi> There is none but this that is worth a ruſh: The reſt are all ſo vain and infirm, that none but fools will truſt unto them.</p>
               <p>He had no ſooner ſaid this, but before there could be any room for a reply, they were all accoſted by another man of a quite different ſhape and humour from this; more ſad and melancholy, more rude, and of an heavier wit alſo; who croſſed their way upon the right hand. He making a ſtop a while as they
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:101895:220"/>paſſed by him, and hearing them talk of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> made no more ado but chopt into their company, and told them that if they were going thither, they held a very unſafe courſe; and ſhould wander in by-paths for ever, unleſs they went along with him in the way that he would ſhew them. To be ſhort; He preſſed them ſo earneſtly, with ſo loud a voice and ſo much heat, that the ſweat dropt down from his face. He did little leſs than thunder among them, and threatned them with eternal deſtruction if they did not hearken to him. And in fine he told them that he had cauſe to be thus vehement, for he was ſure he was in the right, and could not miſguide them. I like you the worſe for that, ſaid the young Pilgrim (who thought himſelf ſufficient to deal with this Hot-ſpur) and we ſhould have believed you ſooner if you had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Infallibility, and withall been ſo unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. We met with your Elder Brother juſt now whom you ſee here, though perhaps you are not well acquainted with him. And if we could be moved at all with confidence, and the pretences of an unerring ſpirit, he had got the ſtart of you, and you had come too late to beg our aſſent. You both ſet up an Oracle, but his is the ancienter of the two; and more reſorted unto, and far better cuſtomed than yours. I wiſh that both your pretenſions were more modeſt. For me-thinks there is nothing ſo hateful as a man that gives us nothing but words, and is angry that we will not believe him. It would put a wiſe man into a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to ſee one uſe threatning geſtures inſtead of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And provoke him to think the uſe of ſpeech a miſchief, when he hears poor and ſimple ſtuff uttered in terms that carry the ſtile of Edicts. But beſides this I obſerve, that as this man would have pulled out
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:101895:220"/>mine eyes, ſo you would pull away from me my Guide. You would have me travel alone by my own fancy, and take my ſelf to be as wiſe as the beſt. But for my part, I will alwayes be of the Religion which reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences the Conductors of Souls: and am glad with all mine heart that I have met with one both to teach and to watch over me. He would lead me as if I was a Beaſt, and had no underſtanding, and you would have me run like a Mad-man on my own head; but there is a middle between theſe and that is reaſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Guidance of the Wiſe. He would take away all Judgment from us: and you would have us take it all to our ſelves. I like neither, but would take ſome, and leave the reſt to others. Do not think, but that I will judge for my ſelf; but yet I will take a Director with me as God hath appointed, that ſo I may ſee to judge the better. Give me my eyes, ſay I to him that layes his hands upon them: and yet I cry to my Guide when I ſee the cleareſt, Lend me yours, for they are like to be better than mine own. A great many eyes are ſafer than one: Others may ſee that which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcover my ſelf. Intereſt, Pride, Paſſion, and Prejudice have too great an hand in our own determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; if I can find none that are quite void of them, yet I will conſult with thoſe that are like to have leſs than my ſelf. And if I cannot judge according to their ſenſe, yet I will never impoſe my own upon them. If I cannot follow, yet I will not preſume to lead. If I cannot be ſo humble as to quit my reaſon, yet I will not be ſo arrogant as to take upon me to Guide them, or to become a confident Teacher of others. Modeſty inſtructs me to think, that if they may miſtake, much more may I: that if they whoſe work it is to enquire into Truth, are not ſecure from Error, then I cannot
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:101895:221"/>claim that priviledge who have many other buſineſſes to attend. I will neither therefore contradict their opinion, nor deny my own. I will neither for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent become their follower, nor yet forſake their guidance.</p>
               <p>The ſtranger did not expect to be encountred with ſuch an oppoſition as this, and ſo betray'd a little amazement at it. And beſides he was the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded when the <hi>Pilgrim</hi> eſpying a Dagger by his ſide, and a Piſtol peeping out of his pocket, thus proceeded to diſcourſe to him. But though you two are ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in your opinions, yet me-thinks you conſpire too much in your cruel practices. That young weapon of yours which I ſee at your Girdle doth make me ſtart. Your Dagger I doubt when it is a little fleſhed, will in a ſhort time grow to be a Sword. You are of the ſame perſecuting ſpirit with your neighbour, and will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no body to be of a contrary mind to your ſelf. And it is the worſe in you, becauſe you have often pretended to liberty, and will give none. It is your ſelf, I ſee, that you love, and no body elſe. You cry out of thoſe bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, which you are ready to lay on other mens backs. You do that, of which you complain; and deſire only to change places with thoſe againſt whom you perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually murmure. If you could but agree in other things, it would be beſt for you to go together, and leave us to our ſelves. Though we would willingly come to a fair accord (being I hope the children of peace) yet I doubt you are of the humour of thoſe men who are ſo obſtinate that they will not ſtoop a jot, nor bow their heads, though it be to take up ſuch a Bleſſed thing as Peace. It is very ſad indeed that there ſhould be ſuch natures found in the world, but it is ſo apparent
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:101895:221"/>that there are; that you will have a difficult taſk of it, to clear your ſelf from the imputation of being of that wilful party. Though Peace lye at their feet and intreat them to condeſcend a little for its ſake, they do not love it ſo well as to purchaſe it with the leaſt abatement of their own deſires. There is no way to divert their imagination from the object on which it is pitcht: and if they be once reſolved a thing muſt be done, all the world cannot change them from their aim. They are enemies to all accommodation, and ſo tyed to the forms they preſcribe themſelves; that it is impoſſible to reduce them to any equity, or to render them capable to remit of their rigour. Nay ſo far do ſome men forget themſelves, that as many who obſerve it have complained, they would rather fall, than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend and come down. They deſire all or nothing: they ſeek Death or elſe Victory. As for Peace which lyes between both, and which ought alwayes to be fought for by the vanquiſhed, and deſired by the victorious, they nothing care; unleſs they may have it on their own terms and conditions. If you intend then to have our company, you muſt throw away this ſtubborn, ſtiff, and reſolute diſpoſition which makes men loſe Peace for little or nothing. A yielding, compliant and gentle nature is the great friend of Peace, and the only ſoil wherein it will grow. For the preparing of which ſoil, there is nothing ſo neceſſary as Humility. It is Pride generally that makes men ſo obſtinate and pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. A conceit of themſelves makes them fondly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that every body muſt ſubmit to them, and they to none. This therefore is as great an enemy to our happy agreement, as any the world hath. It obſtructs all paſſages to it: it makes a man ſtand upon puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio's and formalities, as if they were of equal conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:101895:222"/>to Peace and Unity. It preferrs the leaſt trifle which ſupports its Grandeur before the greateſt Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that Heaven can beſtow. It makes men endleſly wrangle, when all that they can ſay ſignifies nothing, but that they have no mind to yield. You are better ſkilled than I it is to be preſumed in the Hiſtory of ancient times: And you cannot well chuſe but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſomething of a conteſt between the <hi>Athenians</hi> and King <hi>Philip</hi> about an Iſle that he had taken from them, and had a mind to reſtore. But then you cannot alſo but call to mind, how learnedly one of their proud Orators adviſed them, that if the words of the Treaty did import that he gave it to them, they ſhould refuſe it. He would rather have them loſe that which they could not get, than not have it by way of ſurrender, &amp; reſtitution to them. Was not this a ſtrange foolery? What was it elſe but to prize the vanity of a word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſolidity of the thing, as one hath obſerved on that Story? To ſtand upon a fancy and ſhadow of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, when a real intereſt was concerned? But ſuch is the nature of Pride, which thinks it ſelf diſgraced if you pluck an hair out of its head; and takes it ſelf to be undone, if it loſe but a word. Pride would have it ſo; and that will be obeyed, though men ſuffer ſoundly for it. And are not moſt of the Controverſies that divide the world about matters of the like high moment? Are they not in great part a ſcuffling about ſyllables, and a fighting with ſhadows and Idols of our own Imagination? Is there not very hot bickerings about hard phraſes? And is it not thought enough to make a man be killed, if he do not believe a barbarous word? Conſider whether your weapons are not like to be ingaged in theſe doughty quarrels. Whether you have not ſharpened them to ſerve in the cauſe of
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:101895:222"/>words. I doubt thoſe that I ſee you arm'd withall are provided to protect Cob-webs, and to defend the idle dreams and phantaſms of Sophiſters. But is not the World in a ſad caſe in the mean time? Is it not very ſtrange that it ſhould be ſo much at leiſure? They know very well ſure how to live and how to dye, or elſe they would find themſelves ſomething elſe to do. It ſeems God hath not told them enough to employ them, and ſo they invent words out of their own brain about which to fight eternally. Away for ſhame with this Vanity and Pride. Away with this conceitedneſs which hath thus embroiled the whole Earth, and ſeeks to draw Heaven into the Contention too. If you would have us joyn with you in any thing, it muſt be in our prayers, that God would give men ſuch a right ſenſe of themſelves, that they may become humble and lowly in heart. To this we will ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> both for our ſelves and all others. We will beg this day and night that he would incline mens hearts to peace, by incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to yield one to another. That he would beſtow upon them a ſoft and gentle diſpoſition of mind. That he would mollifie their hardneſs, and ſmoothe the roughneſs and ſeverity of their ſpirits. That all may be willing to quit their particular deſires for the General Good. That Self-denyal may have as great a place in all mens hearts as it hath in our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And that all who call themſelves after the name of Chriſt, may learn of their Maſter, who was meek and lowly in heart; who did not cry, neither was his voice heard in the ſtreet: who did not quench the ſmoaking Flax, nor break the bruiſed Reed. Who did bear with the infirmities of thoſe that followed him, and is now ſuch an High Prieſt as can have compaſſion on the ignorant and them that are out of the way. Of
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:101895:223"/>theſe things we can be infallibly aſſured, and if you have mind to be as confident of other matters which we think either doubtful or falſe; trouble not the World with it, and we will not trouble you nor envy to you the height of your illumination.</p>

               <head type="sub">A Diſcourſe with ſome Pilgrims that were going to <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto,</hi> the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> or ſuch like places.

Of which a Leaſe may be bought of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, for a ſmall matter.</head>
               <p>WHen the two Champions (for ſo they eſteemed themſelves) ſaw that there was no ground to be won of theſe men, they thought it beſt to quit the field, eſpecially ſince the night was coming on a pace to part them. They made therefore but a ſhort return to what had been objected to them, and then both ſides expreſſing all the kindneſs that might be towards each other and promiſing to live in Charity, they took their ſeveral courſes. And as for our two friends, they did but rid themſelves of this company, to make room for a new. For having bequeathed their wearied bones to reſt in ſuch a bed as they could get, betimes the next morning they met with a cluſter of <hi>Pilgrims</hi> (as they called themſelves) in a very poor habit and much weather-beaten; who were got together under a tree, relating their ſeveral Pilgrimages which either they
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:101895:223"/>intended, or had already performed. To this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they were very deſirous to joyn themſelves a while; and it being admitted, they found one of them telling how holy a place Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was which he was going to viſit with great devotion. And I, ſaid another, ſhall go your way; for there is a Vow upon me to go and ſee the Oak of <hi>Mamre</hi> under which <hi>Abraham</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Angels. But firſt, ſaid a third, let us go to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> whither I am bound, to ſee the ſanctified places which our Saviours feet have trod. The place where he made the <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> and where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles made the <hi>Creed.</hi> The Olive tree alſo ſtill ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard by the houſe of <hi>Annas,</hi> to which Chriſt was tyed when they brought him to be examined by him. For you muſt know, by the way, that <hi>Annas</hi> being faſt aſleep when he was taken and they being loath to awake him, they got a cord and bound our Saviour to this tree leſt he ſhould ſlip away before the High Prieſt aroſe. But eſpecially I intend to viſit the Holy Sepulchre, and to behold the place where he lay, which I have heard is an action very meritorious. And I, ſaid a fourth, am ingaged to go to our <hi>Lady</hi> of <hi>Loretto</hi> to ſee the very Chamber where ſhe was born, and where ſhe was educated by <hi>Joachim</hi> her Father and <hi>Ann</hi> her Mother; and where the Angels came to her and ſhe conceived our Lord. This I hope is as meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious if not more, as to travel to his grave (and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it is a ſhorter journey) for I have heard one ſay of this place as I believe you never heard any ſay of the other, that the words of <hi>Jacob</hi> do well befit it, <hi>This place is dreadful, it is no other then the Houſe of God, and the gate of Heaven.</hi> You ſpeak ſo highly of theſe holy places, ſaid a fifth, that I ſhould have a great mind to accompany you to ſome of them, were I not now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:101895:224"/>turning home from a Pilgrimage which I have made to St. <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Compoſtella,</hi> wherein I have ſpent more time then I could well ſpare from my neceſſary affairs. O then ſaid the Father (who had liſtned attentively all this while to them without ſpeaking a word) you have brought home I preſume to your family one Feather at leaſt of the Holy Cock or Hen which are kept in a certain Church of an ancient City not far from that place. I hope you will favour us with a ſight of it, for here is no air ſtirring to blow it away if it ſhould chance to fall; and this company I believe would be glad if you would bleſs their lips with a kiſs of it. I do not know well what you mean ſaid the man, for I never ſo much as heard of any ſuch thing. That is very ſtrange replyed the Father, that they ſhould either ſuffer ſo ſacred a breed to periſh, or that the fame of them ſhould not come to your ears. There is ſcarce any <hi>Pilgrim</hi> who paſſes that way who doth not go to ſee them, and therefore I may well marvel that you ſhould hear no news of them: though I ſhall ſooner believe that; than that they ſhould be ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as to let thoſe Holy Chickens dye, whoſe great Grandfather and Grandmother were ſo miraculous an inſtance of the Vertue of St. <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Compoſtella!</hi> I pray Sir ſaid another of them be pleaſed to let us hear the ſtory of theſe Sacred Creatures, for we are all I believe very ignorant of it. I will tell it you then ſaid he juſt as I received it from a perſon of no mean ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that lived in <hi>Sicily</hi> but was well acquainted with all theſe Countryes.<note place="margin">Luc. Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus de Reliq.</note> There was on a time a certain man, a great friend of God (whoſe name he was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conceal) who undertook a Pilgrimage, together with his wife and ſon to the Saint forenamed. It was their fortune being in their journey thither to take up
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:101895:224"/>their Quarters one night in an old City not many miles from it, they being not able that day to reach as far as <hi>Compoſtella.</hi> Now in the houſe that entertained them you muſt know there was a maid not ſo good as ſhe was pretty, who beholding the beauty of their ſon fell in love with him: and made ſuch undecent expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of it, that he was forced to be more uncivil to her then otherwiſe he ſhould have been. This turned her love into a great hatred, and made her ſtudy a revenge, which ſhe took in this manner. There being a little ſilver cup which they uſed in their Chamber, ſhe neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conveighed it into his Capouch, and when they were gone out of the City cauſed them to be purſued by the <hi>Alcalde</hi> or Juſtice of the place and accuſed them of theft. When the Father and Mother had been ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and nothing was found they were ſome thing trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the moleſtation which they had given them; but as ſoon as ever they came to the ſon, they happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to feel it there, where they little expected to have found it; and ſo carried them back again. The young man being brought before the Juſtice could only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the fact, but was no way able to purge himſelf, and therefore was condemned to be hang'd. On the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows then his Father and Mother were fain to leave him, and as the ſtory goes there he hung by the neck till they had been at <hi>Compoſtella,</hi> and performed all their vows to the <hi>Saint.</hi> And his Mother going to viſit the Gibbet at her return, and to ſpend a few tears at the place of execution, found him in the very ſame poſture wherein they left him. But ſhe had not poured out many complaints, nor lookt upon him long with her eyes full of tears, before he called out to her and ſaid; Dear Mother, weep no more I beſeech you for me, for I am not dead as you imagine but alive; being
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:101895:225"/>preſerved by the Mother of God and the interceſſion of St. <hi>James</hi> whom you went to honour, from ſuffering the death which my enemies intended me. Go to the Judge therefore and make no longer ſtay here: Let him know how it is, that I was accuſed out of meer malice, unjuſtly condemned, and thus miraculouſly ſaved by them that protect the innocent and are grateful to their Worſhippers. She did ſo, without examining him any further about the matter; and the Judge was juſt ſate down to dinner when ſhe came running in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sir, I beſeech you cauſe my ſon to be taken down and let him hang yonder no longer, for though I muſt confeſs that he is ſtill alive, yet it is by the power of God and his Saints. At which news he ſmiling ſaid, Good woman be content; thy Son is as much alive, as theſe two Birds; pointing to a Cock and Hen which were ready roaſted upon the Table before him. He had no ſooner ſaid the word, but they both leapt out of the diſh and walkt about the Table, being as ready for a dinner as himſelf. And as for the Cock, he moreover clapped his wings and fell a Crowing for joy to find them unpinion'd, and to feel that he did not carry his giſcern thereabouts any longer. Which when the Judge beheld, he was the moſt aſtoniſhed man that ever was ſeen, and could not of a good while recover himſelf to ſpeak a word. But as ſoon as ever the paſſion was over, away he went without ſo much as thinking of his dinner, and called the Prieſt with the Principal men of the City, who all went together to the place where the Youth was hang'd; and found it to their no ſmall wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, juſt as the good Woman had ſaid. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he was cut down and reſtored to his Parents; but the Cock and Hen as more Sacred things were carried
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:101895:225"/>in much ſolemnity to the great Church; and there a Coop was made for them, that they might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as a monument of the great power of God. Of what colour they were before, my Author ſaid, he did not know; but after their reſurrection they were of a pure white ſnow-like colour. It is uncertain alſo what they did while the Judge was gone to the place of Execution, but afterward it is not to be doubted they lived very purely. For ſeven years being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed by God for the term of this new life which they had received, they left no more then two Chickens behind them when they dyed; nor had they ever any more iſſue. Theſe two alſo lived juſt the ſame number of years, and had the like poſterity; and ſo it hath continued in that order to this day. Now all knowing men judge it no leſs then a Miracle, that the Cock ſhould never tread the Hen above once in his life. And then that he begets juſt two Eggs. And that one of theſe alwayes brings forth a Cock, and the other an Hen. And that at the punctual time of ſeven years end, which you know is a perfect number, they leave the World, and reſt in peace. For though the reporter of this did not tell me what became of their bodies, yet you may be ſure, that they never came upon the Spit more. And as for their Feathers, the mention of which occaſioned the telling of this ſtory, you muſt know that they are preſerved as an holy Relique, and all people that paſs to S. <hi>James</hi> through this City, uſe to viſit this Church and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain one of them. And here now is another won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that though there are innumerable perſons which paſs through it, yet they never want feathers; as he tells me who was at the place, and himſelf wore one of them continually about him.</p>
               <pb n="434" facs="tcp:101895:226"/>
               <p>O Sir, ſaid he that had been at <hi>Compoſtella,</hi> how happy a man ſhould I have thought my ſelf if it had been my fortune to meet with you before I took this long journey. I had then been a great deal richer then I am; and brought a treaſure home with me which now alas! I want. I could be tempted if my occaſions would yield to it to return back, if it were but to ſee the faces of this chaſte Pair, who never come together, but only to beget ſuch another bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed couple as themſelves. Who knows what vertue it might infuſe into ones mind? Or of what power ſo holy a relique is againſt all the aſſaults of the enemy? Well, I ſhall never ſee a roaſted Pullet more, but I ſhall ſigh at my loſs: And yet I believe I ſhall ſee one very often, for it is a diſh I love very well. But I pray Sir, did you ever meet with any body that had one of thoſe pretious Feathers?</p>
               <p>The good man was ſorely grieved to ſee the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and innocence of ſuch perſons as they ſeemed to be ſo eaſily abuſed; and therefore he thought good to undiſguiſe himſelf and anſwered him in plain manner to this effect. No truly, nor do I care one ſtraw whether I ever do or no. For though I have heard this Story very confidently related, yet I would be ſorry if you ſhould think me ſo credulous as to receive it for a truth. Nay I ſhould hold my ſelf worthy to be Chronicled for a fool, ſhould I va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue one of thoſe feathers any more, then ſuch an one as a Fool wears in his Cap. And I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that men with ſuch Reverend Beards as yours, ſhould ſurrender your belief to ſuch ſottiſh tales. You ſeem otherwiſe ſagacious enough, and therefore whence is it that your heads are fraught with ſuch
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:101895:226"/>that they cannot diſcern the groſsneſs of theſe cheats? If you can ſwallow a lye ſo great as this; ſure the ſtory of <hi>Gargantua</hi> will not ſtick with you, but go down eaſily. Who cutting up a miraculouſly great Colewort in his Garden, within the leaves of which ſix Pilgrims like your ſelves lay aſleep; eat it and them one morning for his Breakfaſt in a Sallet. Nay you will be able to digeſt what follows, how that one of theſe got into an hollow tooth that was in his Mouth, and ſo ſaved himſelf. For wondring into what Gulph it was that he was faln, he tryed if it were poſſible to feel any bottom; and at laſt gave his tooth ſuch a prick with the pike-end of his Staff, that the Giant immediatly ſpit him out. At leaſt I may well think that if you had lived an Age or two agone, you would have gone to do your devotion to <hi>Thomas à Becket;</hi> reverently kiſſing his Breeches, and laying your lipps with much affection to the Handkercheif wherewith he was wont to wipe his ſnotty Noſe. Nay, be not offended I beſeech you at the expreſſion, nor think that I ſpeak with too much rudeneſs;<note place="margin">Eraſm. Colloq. peregr. Rell. ergò.</note> for they thought it none I'le aſſure you heretofore, to offer to the peoples ſalutation, ſuch an holy relique, as had the very prints and footſteps of the Snot ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it.</p>
               <p>I cannot but be offended ſaid one of the company at theſe reflections of yours upon the Story you have told us, and me thinks you do very ill to laugh at ſuch ſerious things; which are alſo atteſted by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſo good Authors, that if your heart was not very ſtony and hard to entertain any thing, you could not but admit them for truth. If they were worthy of a ſerious confutation replyed the Father, I
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:101895:227"/>ſhould but render my ſelf ridiculous by laughing at them. But ſince they appear to all unprejudiced men to be meer fopperies, it is I think our duty to ſmile at them. For the Holy Scripture it ſelf doth plainly mock at the folly and abſurdneſs of ſome mens opinions and doings.<note place="margin">1 King 18.27. &amp; v. Iſa. 44.1 52 16, 17.</note> You remember ſure how <hi>Elijah</hi> flouted at <hi>Baal</hi> and his Worſhippers, when he ſaid, perhaps their God was a talking with ſome body, and could not hear them both together; or he might not be at home and ſo could give no anſwer; or elſe ſo faſt aſleep (having eaten perhaps too much the night before of the Sacrifices which they brought him) except they called ſtill louder he would not awake. And ſo the Mount of Olives is called by way of contempt, not <hi>Har Miſcheh</hi> the Mount of Unction,<note place="margin">2 Kings 23.13.</note> but <hi>Har Maſhchith</hi> the Mount of Corruption.

And yet I have not done ſo much, becauſe I think theſe things are ſo groſly ridiculous, that they laugh themſelves to ſcorn. I have only told the plain ſtory of them, and that confutes it ſelf ſufficiently. To expoſe things of this nature to the world is abundantly to diſprove them. To bring them into view is to put them to ſhame, and make them hide their face. To make mention of them, is enough to ſilence them. We need not be at the trouble to abuſe them, for they make Invectives againſt themſelves, and carry their
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:101895:227"/>own Satyrs in their boſome. Not to ſpeak of them is the only Civility we can do them. It is neceſſary to ſhut our eyes if you would not have us ſmile at the folly which they reveal to us. We do not firſt ſtrip them and then lay the laſh upon them; for as ſoon as they appear, they diſcover their own nakedneſs, and carry a whip at their own backs. But ſuppoſe any of them be more neatly contrived and cunningly painted the better to deceive; would you not have us pull off the Mask or waſh off the paint, that we may ſhew things in their proper colours? That is all that we intend; and therefore be not angry at it. If we ſhould throw never ſo much ſalt in your face, you would receive no harm, unleſs you be raw and ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. But I beſeech you what are the Authors you ſpeak of, upon whoſe credit we are to receive theſe things; are they not ſuch as need ſome body of more credit to be their Vouchers? To cite the authority of ſuch men, is as if you ſhould bring thoſe for your ſureties; for whoſe honeſty not only Certificates, but alſo pawns and engagements of Bodies would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from other men that are better known then themſelves. Not only we, but ſome that believe as you do in other things, have the honeſty to accuſe the fraud of the firſt beginners of theſe ſtories, and the folly of them that follow their Sotteries. They do not ſtick to ſay that they are very dull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ſuch as never are wont to blow their Noſes, who do not ſmell the forgery of them that firſt ſtuff their Sermons, and then their Writings with ſuchlike tales. Nay, in plain words they tell us, that all Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories within ſeven or eight hundred years laſt paſt, are ſo hydropically ſwoln with lying <hi>Legends,</hi> that a man would think the Authors of them had made it
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:101895:228"/>their main ſtrife, who ſhould advance the greateſt number.</p>
               <p>Then, ſaid one of the Pilgrims, you do not believe I warrant, the ſtory of St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to St. <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confeſſor</hi> in ſuch an habit as you now ſee us wear, and craving an Alms of him: who gave him his Ring off from his finger, knowing nothing but that he was a poor man that ſtood in need of a great Charity. Did not God do a great honour herein to Pilgrimages and the holy Reliques which they went to viſit? Indeed, ſaid the Father again, I have not faith enough to believe it; and I wonder much how you came to know that St. <hi>John</hi> went a begging to that pious Prince. O, ſaid the other, that is a thing not hard to know, for as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Abbot</hi> hath told us, St. <hi>John</hi> himſelf revealed it to two Engliſh men as they were going to viſit the Holy Sepulchre. For they being in danger to looſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in an unknown Countrey, were directed in their way by that bleſſed Apoſtle. Who told them they ſhould have a proſperous Voyage, and that God and he would be propitious to them for their good Kings ſake; whom I loved (ſaid he) very tenderly for the excellency of his Chaſtity. I am <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle, and you ſhall carry back this Ring to him which he gave me ſome dayes ſince; and let him know that the day of his death approaches, and that ſix moneths ſhall not paſs over his head, ere I put him into the company of thoſe Virgins which follow the Lamb whereſoever he goes. Truly, replyed the Father with a ſmile, I am no more ſatisfied then I was before; and cannot poſſibly reſign up my belief to any ſuch relations of the droniſh Monks of thoſe days. This ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:101895:228"/>ſeems to me to be juſt as true as another which the ſame <hi>Abbot</hi> reports; how that St. <hi>Edward</hi> one day ſaw <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf upon the Altar, ſtretching forth his hand to bleſs him with the ſign of the Croſs, as he was worſhipping of the Hoſt and adoring the Divine preſence there. A thing that was never talkt of till he was dead as the Author of it acknowledges: and then it was pretended, that he had given it in charge to the Earl that ſaw this apparition with him, and conjured him moſt ſacredly that he ſhould ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it while he lived. Which is as much as to ſay, that it ſhould not be told while it could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by that Good King, who would have made this lye to have ſtuck in the Authors throat.</p>
               <p>I perceive, ſaid another of the Pilgrims, that you have obſtinately bolted your heart againſt all theſe pious Stories; but yet I hope you do not diſallow of all Pilgrimages; nor think it unprofitable for the ſouls health to go to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to worſhip at the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre of our Lord. To tell you the truth, replyed he, all is alike to me. I do not imagine there is any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in that Land more then in any other; nor can I have an opinion of any Sanctity that I ſhall bring away with me if I ſhould go thither. And therefore it is far better to employ our ſelves well at home, then to take ſo long a journey to do that which may as well be done in any other place. That's ſtrange, anſwered the other, I ſee now you matter not though you disbelieve the Scriptures themſelves, which give us many examples of Holy Pilgrimages. As the Lame you know and the blind went up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be healed in the Pool of <hi>Betheſda.</hi>

But howſoever that be, you may ſee if you will that they are as old as Chriſt himſelf, and were conceived as Wiſe men judge at the very ſame time with him. For he went a Pilgrimage in the Womb of his Mother to ſee <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in the Hill Countrey. And after that he went from <hi>Nazareth</hi> in <hi>Galilee</hi> to <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem Judah</hi> when ſhe was near the time of her travel.<note place="margin">Pitſ. l. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>2.</hi> de peregr.</note> And as he honoured Pilgrimages thus in his Mothers belly, ſo afterward when he hung on her breaſt he travelled into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and after that returned into <hi>Judaea,</hi> and every year went up to the Temple of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have waited a great while, ſaid the Father, who here interrupted him, for ſome word or other that ſhould drop from your mouth to the purpoſe; but I have no hopes to meet with it. Sure you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got what you were ſpeaking about, and ſome holy Feather or Toy hath taken you in the head, which you dreamt you ſhould find at laſt in ſome of theſe places. Do you think that we go a pilgrimage every time we take a journey, or go to the next Church, or make a friend a Viſit, or are carried to the Bath in a Litter for our health? Or was there ſomething ſacred in <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Officers, or any holy reliques in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which the Bleſſed Virgin, and our Saviour went to do ſome adoration unto? Yes, ſaid the other, who was glad to catch hold of this laſt word, there were the Bones of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet to which perhaps they paid a reſpect, for be lay buried in the Royal City and was alwayes honoured by the <hi>Egyptians</hi> for the ſingular benefits which they received from him.
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:101895:229"/>You are ignorant perhaps that the Crocodiles, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hurtful Serpents were baniſhed their coaſts by his interceſſion; and that in the dayes of our fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the faithful were wont to go to his Tomb and ſay their prayers; and bringing away ſome of the duſt of that place, it was a certain cure for thoſe who were hurt by any venemous beaſt. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, replyed He, we are much indebted to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this Legend, who hath acquainted us with ſome other things which the Holy Writers forgot to tell us. As that the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> foretold to the <hi>Egyptians</hi> that all their Images ſhould fall to the ground when a Virgin and her Son ſhould come into that Land. Which was the cauſe, ſaith he, that even in thoſe dayes they placed a Virgin in her Bed, and an Infant in a Manger, and gave adoration to them. Of which when the reaſon was demanded by King <hi>Ptolomy</hi> (you muſt not enquire which of them) the Prieſts anſwered that it was a Myſtery delivered by their Elders, which they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Holy Prophet. Perhaps then you think that the Bleſſed Virgin went to let her Son ſee theſe ſine Pictures of himſelf and her. Or that they took this Journey to provide themſelves with a Boxfull of that holy duſt againſt a time of need. Sure if the Jews had but known any thing of that knack, it would have ſerved them very much; and they would have maintain'd that he did many of his Miracles in the Vertue of their great Prophet. Was this the reaſon think you that they ſaid <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was riſen from the dead? What do you think of us that you ſhould ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it poſſible to captivate our belief to ſuch lubberly lyes as theſe? Certainly you take us for very thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkull'd people; or elſe they are ſo themſelves, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing their time rather in gleaning what is ſcattered
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:101895:230"/>up and down in every place, than in weighing the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the men from whom they borrow their Notes; have filled their Books and the World with whole Cart-loads of theſe Chimerical Stories.</p>
               <p>Here the man having continued mute a while, at laſt burſt out into theſe words not without ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, well, I will produce an unanſwerable place; <hi>Where the Body is, there will the Eagles be gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> What ſay you now?<note place="margin">V.

Have thoſe Infidels got our Lord into their hands? Was that the end of the Holy War to redeem him from Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and reſcue him out of the power of his enemies? I poor Soul verily believed all this while that he had been in the Heavens, in the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above: whither I and my Companion are travelling as faſt as we can. Thither if you have a mind to go, come along with us. We will flye if you pleaſe like ſo many Eagles. We will run and not be weary, we will walk and not faint; we will ſtretch our wings to their utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and not be tyred. In this Pilgrimage we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſpend our whole lives, but ſhall think that we are very much out of our way, ſhould we enter with you upon any other. Here he gave them a ſhort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the manner of their life, and ſhewed them how and where they ſought for <hi>Jeſus.</hi> He diſcourſed of Humility, of Charity, and the reſt of the Vertues which are ſo eminent in our Saviours Example: The imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of whom, ſaid he, was ever held the higheſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and worſhip that could be given him. By this he

They would ſave men the labour of taking a long Pilgrimage to viſit the Shrines of the Saints. For they become ſuch themſelves, and are the beſt reliques of them which the World affords. And leſt you ſhould think, added he, that we adhere too much to our own opinions, and put too great a ſleight upon the Pilgrimages in which you are ingaged, let me intreat you patiently to hear what a perſon of great authority with you ſpeaks of them, in an Age when they had but newly begun to gain a reputation among men.</p>

                  <hi>that he doth a thing of great note, and much to be valued, when he takes a Journey to the place where our Lord was buried. But he himſelf, when he ſpeaks of thoſe that ſhall inherit the Kingdom of Heaven, doth not mention the Pilgrimages to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>as a worthy undertaking. Nor when he pronounces his Beatitudes, doth he at all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this labour and diligence. Why ſhould any man therefore trouble himſelf about that which will not make him Bleſſed, nor diſpoſe him at all for his Coeleſtial Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance? And if there were no dangers (as there are too many) of being defiled and corrupted in the paſſage thither by ſundry vices, yet what ſhall a man be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when he arrives in ſafety there? Is our Lord to be found there, more than in the place where at preſent we are? Or is there a greater meaſure of the Holy Spirit
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:101895:231"/>at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>which will not vouchſafe to come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Muſt we go ſo far to fetch its comforts, and will it not be intreated to impart them nearer at hand? Truly I muſt needs ſay that I ſee more devotion, more piety, more of all divine Vertues in this very place, than there is to be found. I my ſelf went thither once upon my occaſions, yet I did not feel my ſelf a whit the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, or the better by it. What I believed then, I believed before; what I did there, I could do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I went thither; and I reaped no greater bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by my Journey, than to find that the places where we live are more holy, than thoſe that we ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire. You therefore that fear God, praiſe him there where you have your preſent abode, and trouble not your ſelves to ſeek any other place wherein to do him honour. The change of place will never bring you nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to him. But be you where you will, there God will be too, if your ſouls be fit to give him lodging, and receive ſo Holy a Gueſt. If you have your inward man full of perverſe and evil thoughts, though you were in</hi> Golgotha, <hi>though you ſtood upon Mount</hi> Olivet, <hi>though you lay even under the Monument of the Reſurrection; you are as far from entertaining Chriſt as the Stones that incloſed him. I adviſe therefore all the Brethren, that they travel out of the Body to the Lord, and not go out of</hi> Cappadocia <hi>to</hi> Palaeſtine.</p>
               <p>And in another place writing to certain devout perſons, he tells them that there is nothing more pleaſant than to converſe with pious Souls, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what things the Grace of our Lord hath done for them. <hi>It is no leſs,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>than a Feſtival, and preſents us with ſuch goodly ſpectacles, that one cannot but think he ſees in an heart full of God, both</hi> Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:101895:231"/>
                  <hi>and</hi> Golgotha, <hi>and the Mount of</hi> Olives, <hi>and the place of the</hi> Reſurrection. <hi>Shew me a man in whom Chriſt is formed by a good Conſcience, who by the fear of God is nailed to the Croſs. Who hath rolled away the burdenſome Stone of Worldly Vanity, and being got out of the Tomb of his Body, walks in newneſs of life. Who leaving the low and creeping life of the World in which he was buried, aſcends by the force of lofty deſires to the Coeleſtial Converſation. Who ſetting his affections on things above, is not weighed down by the weight of his Body, but made ſo light and aetherial by a purer life, that his fleſh becomes like a bright cloud which is willing to mount up with him to the things on high. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in my judgment deſerves to be numbred among thoſe ſo much celebrated things, in which we may plainly ſee the Monuments of the kindneſs of our Lord towards us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus that great Man delivers his opinion to us, and we cannot but readily yield him our aſſent. Theſe are the Holy Places which we deſire to behold. A man dying unto ſin, preſents us with the faireſt ſight of Chriſts Sepulchre. It ſets us upon Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> when we meet with a Soul of a Coeleſtial Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And I thank our Lord very much that I ſee ſuch manifeſt marks and footſteps of theſe things in this my friend, in whom the burying, the riſing again, and the aſcention of Chriſt is moſt lively pictured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine eyes. As for thoſe places in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> where you are going to adore, if they were ſo little worth in thoſe dayes, I think their price is more faln now: and if they that lived nearer to them thought good to ſtay at home, it will be a ſilly piece of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition in us to travel ſo far in devotion to them.</p>

                  </note> the Church of St. <hi>John Lateran</hi> afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no leſs then forty eight years of pardon every day in the year, together with the pardon of the third part of all a mans ſins. And if you would have ſome other kind of food for your ſouls which is more viſible, there is in that Church to be beheld among other reliques, ſome of the fragments of the five barly loaves and the two fiſhes wherewith Chriſt fed five thouſand men. Some poor body I ſuppoſe on whom they might be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd after dinner brought them thither, being ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the meer ſight of them, and hoping that others might be ſo in after times. But the more probable opinion is (ſince the poor and rich were admitted to that feaſt) that the fragments falling to the ſhare of thoſe that waited at the Table, and there being juſt twelve Baskets full in all, each of the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had one for his portion; and that St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaved his that he might bring it to <hi>Rome</hi> of which he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that he ſhould be made Biſhop. But to return to what I began to ſay concerning the pardon of ſin which I ſuppoſe you all moſt earneſtly deſire. The
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:101895:232"/>liberal grant already mentioned is but a mite to thoſe vaſt treaſures which two Popes indowed that Church withall, who gave thereto ſo many Indulgences as none can number ſave God alone. So my Author tells me, and if you doubt of it Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> witneſſes to the truth of it in theſe words; If men, ſaith he, did but know the Indulgences belonging to the Church of St. <hi>John</hi> and how many they were, they would never go ſo far beyond the Sea as to the Holy Sepulchre in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but would rather ſpare ſo great a labour. For grant that they are abſolved there both from the guilt and alſo from the puniſhment of their ſins, this is no more then they have nearer at hand in the Church of St. <hi>John.</hi> And do you not think it is a good bargain for a man to forſake totally his riches and lands and ſuch like things, that he may purchaſe ſuch an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible maſs of Spiritual and Divine riches? And yet you need not do ſo much; it is but going thither and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your goods for a time, and then beſides all theſe bleſſings, you ſhall come loadned home with a great deal more pretious commodities, ſuch as <hi>Agnus Dei's,</hi> Holy Pictures, Bleſſed Bread, Sanctified Wood, and a great many other invaluable Jewels.</p>
               <p>To this diſcourſe when one liſtned very devoutly and aſkt him if a man might have all this Wealth at no greater charges but only going for it; He was a little at a ſtand. And told him that his words were not ſo to be interpreted as if he might go fetch ſuch great bleſſings and carry no money with him; for there is nothing to be had at <hi>Rome</hi> unleſs you buy it. It is not to be expected that they ſhould make Holy things ſo cheap as to give them away for aſking. It never was ſo ſince there were Pilgrimages: But the good men
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:101895:233"/>that undertook them carried their purſes full of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and exchanged it for holy Croſſes, bleſſed Grains and ſuch like things as I now mentioned. For elſe how could it be that one Monaſtery in <hi>Helvetia</hi> ſhould be inriched ſo much by the offerings of Pilgrims who came thither, that it was able to take away the Tiles that covered it and inſtead thereof to lay on plates of Gold and Silver? But I hope then, replyed the other, that I ſhall find all that true which you have ſaid and obtain ſo many pardons as you promiſe which indeed I am willing to purchaſe at any rate. O Sir, ſaid He again, you need not doubt at all of it. I have told you nothing yet of the Holineſs of that place and the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church. Which is not ſo much the Miſtreſs of the World, as the Mother of the Faithful, the moſt indulgent Mother that ever was. There is none can tell the vaſtneſs of her Exchequer and the liberal ſums which iſſue out thence unto her children: in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with which all that ſhe receives from them is not worth the naming. In a little Chappel of that Church of St. <hi>John</hi> forementioned, there is remiſſion for all ſins to be had every day. And not far from it, there is a place of that holineſs that you may have no leſs then three and thirty thouſand years of pardon, for once going up a pair of ſtairs. Is it poſſible ſaid the other? Sure this is either not believed, or not known, for otherwiſe all the World would go thither to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from their ſins. There is none I aſſure you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed he, but Hereticks who queſtion the truth of it, and I cannot tell why men are ſo negligent of their Salvation as not to flock more then they do to that Holy City. The thing is plain enough, or was ſo not long ago (and I doubt not of the care of the Church to preſerve things of ſuch value) for there is an aſcent
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:101895:233"/>of three and thirty ſteps, and how oft ſoever any man devoutly goes up to the top of it, for every ſtep he hath a thouſand years of pardon. And wonder not at the thing, for theſe ſteps you muſt know were brought from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and are the very ſame which Chriſt aſcended when he went up before <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> to be judged by him. The women indeed may take it ill that they are not ſuffered to come into this Chappel (it being called the Holy of Holies); and to ſay the truth I was much grieved for them when I firſt heard this, becauſe I know that they have Souls as well as we, and Sins too. But afterward having more diligently ſearched into the matter I found that they will be no great loſers by being ſhut out of this very Sacred place. For though I do not know where they can get ſo many years of pardon at once, yet it is provided that they may have enough; and leſt they ſhould mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, I can tell them this for their comfort, that they may obtain them without the labour of going up a pair of ſtairs. For let but any Pilgrim of either ſex, and at any time of the year go to viſit the Church of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and there are granted to all and every of them by three gracious Popes no leſs then nine thouſand years of Pardon.<note place="margin">Ib cap. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> But if any one be ſo great a ſinner that he thinks all this is not ſufficient, he may know that there are in the Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſo m ny In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences that they are paſt numbring. And yet in the Holy time of Lent, how many ſoever they be,<note place="margin">Cap. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> they are all doubled. I ſuppoſe that you will think it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to have any more then all theſe, but if you are afraid, and would be ſtill furniſhed with ſome additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Indulgences; it is but going to the Church of St. <hi>Mary of the People,</hi> and to thoſe of St. <hi>Vitus, Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. <hi>14.</hi>

<pb n="450" facs="tcp:101895:234"/>a great many thouſand years of pardon more for every day, and beſides as many fortieth parts if you think them of any worth, after ſo large a ſtock which ſure you will never be able to ſpend.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, ſaid the Father, it was intended that he ſhould lend ſome to his poor neighbours if he have no uſe of all this treaſure himſelf, for ſome of them may not be able to go thither. And therefore in my mind (if all this be true) a man ought not to refuſe the leaſt bit of the Charity of the Church, but go to all theſe places and bring away as many Ages of Pardon as ever he can; that ſo he may be charitable unto others. No ſuch matter, anſwered the other, they will do no good to thoſe that do not go to fetch them; being the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the labour and pains that a man takes in a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Pilgrimage. But then, ſaid he again, me thinks the Church ſhould be ſo charitable as to ſend greater ſtore then it doth of theſe bleſſings to them that are not able to take a journey for them. And it hath made me wonder very much that <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be ſo holy a place, and that a pair of ſtairs there ſhould be of ſo great vertue, as to procure greater favours then the blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf in any other Country. For I have read that a little glaſs full of it was procured from the Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Maſter of the Templars and ſent to <hi>Henry</hi> the third King of <hi>England,</hi>

Doth it not ſeem to you very unreaſonable that the ſteps on
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:101895:234"/>which he trod ſhould exceed ſo much in efficacy the blood which he ſhed? Is there not a vaſt diſproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between three and thirty thouſand years of pardon which the former procures, and ſix poor years which the later beſtows? How comes it to paſs that the Pope would do no greater honour to his blood, eſpecially ſince they paid ſo dearly for it? For you muſt know that it was ſent to comfort the people of <hi>England</hi> after he had miſerably oppreſſed them, by levying huge ſums of money and excommunicating all that refuſed to pay them. It ſeems to me as if the Blood of Chriſt it ſelf could do little or nothing unleſs it be at <hi>Rome.</hi> And yet that is not the buſineſs neither, for ſmaller things can do greater matters when the Pope pleaſeth. It is not many years agone ſince <hi>Clement</hi> 8. ſent ſome bags full of little Croſſes and bleſſed Grains to be diſtributed among the people of <hi>France,</hi> accompanied with this Indulgence; that whoſoever had ſome of theſe grains in his Beads, ſhould obtain an hundred years of pardon for every kiſs that he ſhould at any time beſtow upon them. Here was a liberal grant indeed. You ſee what your holy Father can do if he liſt by little trifles of his own making. And therefore all that I am able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude is only this, that nothing can work any more then the Pope will let it, no not the blood of Jeſus Chriſt. And that he was more ſtern in thoſe dayes when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were enſlaved to him; and now he is grown better natur'd, and ſtudies by his kindneſs to oblige his ſubjects; leſt they ſhould all ſhake off the yoke he layes upon them. Or if you had rather ſo conceive it, there is nothing that he can part withall unleſs you pay for it: only now and then he affords you a better pennyworth and lets you have more for your money then at other times, that he may gain your
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:101895:235"/>cuſtom and induce you to truſt him ſo much as to ſuffer him to uſe you as he pleaſes. And truly he uſed our forefathers ſo hardly, that I wonder they continued his chapmen ſo long. He put ſuch baſe commodities, ſuch counterfeit ware into their hands that I cannot tell what ſhould keep them from diſcovering the cheat. I am aſhamed when I think what fools he made of them: and how he uſed them like little infants, impoſing what he thought good upon their belief. It makes me bluſh to reflect on all the toyes wherewith he gull'd them of their money. He ſeems to have had them in ſuch ſervitude that he had ſcarce left them any Souls of their own, but rifled them of all their reaſon. For was it not a ſtrange ſottiſhneſs to believe that he had bottled up the blood of Chriſt, which we know was carried into the Heavens with Him, that He might appear therewith before God for us and perfect our expiation? And yet there were a thouſand of theſe tales that paſſed for currant truth. Nay a Frier of <hi>Gaunt</hi> was wont to ſay that theſe godly frauds and coſenages were the Milk which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave to Babes, as being unable to digeſt the harder meat. Since He intended therefore to keep the World alwayes in its ſwadling clouts, thoſe Nurſes to whom he committed his children fed them with little elſe but this Milk. Of which their Bottles were ſo full, that it was held by wiſe men as good an argument to ſay,<note place="margin">Walſingh. Rich. <hi>2.</hi>

And if this little that hath been ſaid will not ſerve to open your eyes to ſee the fraud, you may go on to traffique with <hi>Rome</hi> as thoſe before you have done.

               <p>THE young man was glad to hear him ſpeak theſe words becauſe they lookt like a concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore pulling him by the ſleeve, he pray'd him not to wait for their anſwer, but leave them to muſe of what he had repreſented ſo plainly to their minds. And I wiſh ſaid he (turning towards them) that if you regard not his diſcourſe, there was ſome ſuch perſon here as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> to whom you bear a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, that he might tell you what he thought of your intended Pilgrimages to <hi>Rome, Loretto,</hi> and ſuch like places.

And ſo having civilly taken their leaves of each other, He and his Guide held on their way to that Holy place where <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf now reſides. Several things they
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:101895:236"/>diſcourſed of, and many good things they did as they went along; till at laſt having gained the top of an high hill (which without ſome difficulty could not be climbed) they met with a knot of more excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who recompenſed for the tediouſneſs of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany into which they had lately faln. The Spectacle which preſented it ſelf was no leſs wonderful then it was new. For there they beheld ſundry <hi>Pilgrims</hi> like themſelves who had placed their bodies, though in ſeveral poſtures, as if they never meant to ſtir from that place; unleſs it was to be carried directly up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Some of them were faln upon their knees; and with their hands upon their breaſts, their eyes eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted toward the skies, and a very ſmiling countenance, they ſeemed not ſo much to aſk as to poſſeſs ſomething that they dearly loved, and for which they rendred thanks to God. Others of them ſtood gazing upon their tip-toes; with their mouths open and their eyes ſo fixed, as if their Souls were gone half way out of their bodies to fetch in ſomething which they hungred to receive. And others alſo ſtretched out their arms to ſuch a length, as if either they ſaw that thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them; or elſe they thought them to be wings whereby they could fly to that which they lookt ſo greedily upon. For this they obſerved after a careful view of them, that every one directed his eyes the ſame way; as if they waited for the very ſame good to deſcend into their embraces. And therefore theſe two perſons being not ſo much ſtartled as raviſhed at this ſtrange ſight, thought it was beſt for them to do ſo too; and to try if they could make any diſcovery of that which attracted all theſe eyes and hearts unto it. And they had not done ſo very long, but by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of this Mountain, and the clearneſs of the air, and
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:101895:236"/>the ſteadineſs of their eyes, and the quiet and ſilence wherein they all were; they had a very fair proſpect of the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now (you may be ſure) our Pilgrims heart skipt for joy; and he began to bleſs the happy day which brought him hither, vowing that it ſhould be markt in his Calender for an <hi>Holy-day</hi> as long as he lived. For he was not only aſſured hereby that there was ſuch a place, but he diſcovered ſomething of the felicities of it; which here met him with a delitious entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It did not ſeem to be ſituate in a Region like to any that he had as yet beheld; but in one ſo clear and pure that the ſky is but a ſmoky vapour in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with it. There was no cloud that durſt be ſo bold as to come within ſight of it; nor was there any darkneſs that could approach to ſully its beauty. But as there was a perpetual ſerenity about it, ſo an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting day was one of the principal ornaments of it. The rayes of the Sun he perceived never hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs from it; if he judged aright when by the glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the place he thought it all guilded with his beams. But ſometimes he conceited that the City was all built of ſuch pretious ſtones; that they ſupplyed the place of the Sun, by thoſe ſtreams of light which iſſued forth from every one of them. Nay the very garments of the Inhabitants (which he could diſcern a little) were ſo gliſtering that they ſeemed able of themſelves to create a continual day to thoſe that wore them. He beheld alſo ſome winged people (for ſuch are they that dwell there) come flying from one of the gates of the City very ſpeedily towards him; who told him that they accompanied him in his journy though he did not ſee them: and that they had been
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:101895:237"/>at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to carry news of his travels thither, and to relate the conſtancy and reſolvedneſs of his mind in this purpoſe: and that they were ſent back again not only to wait upon him, but to let him know that the Lord of the place did wait very paſſionately for his arrival, and would be exceeding glad in ſafety to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him.</p>
               <p>Into what an ecſtaſie he was caſt by this relation, eſpecially when he heard a little whiſpering noiſe (for it was no more) of the Muſick and the melodious Airs which thoſe Choriſters of Heaven make; it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther needleſs to tell you. His Soul was almoſt allured out of his body by this ſight; and was held in by ſo very ſmall a thred, that two or three ſharp thoughts more of that happy place, would have cut in two that ſlender tye. He verily thought that this was <hi>Piſgah,</hi> and that he was gone up to dye there. And when he ſaw that he muſt ſtill live yet he could not but ſay to his Guide, Let us build us a Tabernacle or two in this place; for it is good to be here, untill thoſe winged Miniſters ſhall be at leiſure to come and fetch us away to Heaven. Surely, ſaid he, it cannot be long before they do us that favour. Let us ſit ſtill a while and ſee if our longing ſouls in the poſture wherein they have been, cannot invite them to give us ſatisfaction and tranſport us thither. But his Director (to whom he ever uſed to hearken) told him that this was a thing which a man might rather fancy then deſire. For it could not be permitted that they ſhould ſit alwayes gazing there; neither was there any hopes of arriving at the deſired place, unleſs by their own diligence in ſuch things as God would have them employed, they ſtill indeavoured to creep nearer and nearer unto it.
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:101895:237"/>And me-thinks, added he, it ſhould be ſufficient to content you that the reſt of your way carries the face of ſuch pleaſure, and promiſes ſo much eaſe and faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to you in your paſſage; as you will diſcern if it pleaſe you but a little to turn your eyes from your Journeys end, to behold the path that leads you to it.</p>
               <p>With that the young mans eyes began to fall a little from thoſe lofty places whereon they had been fixed; and to caſt themſelves upon the ground which lay below under his feet, in which he was at preſent to make his abode. But he did not loſe his pleaſure by taking his eyes off from <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> for the rode which lay thither appeared now ſo plain, ſo fair and ſmooth, ſo free from bryers and thorns, and all that had moleſted and galled him before, that it proved the beginning of Heaven to him. The Earth he ſaw was every where loadned with ſo much Plenty; that nothing troubled him but only that he could not ſee Travellers enough to gather it. On every ſide of him there were ſo many beautiful flowers; that he could ſcarce tell whoſe invitation to accept, when they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deſire to be pluckt by his hands. The very ſtones had loſt the hardneſs and roughneſs of their nature; and did ſoften and ſmooth themſelves when the feet of Pilgrims came to oppreſs them. And all the way likewiſe was ſo quiet and ſtill, that if a leaf wagged; it was by the ſweet breath of thoſe Muſicians which ſate among the Branches. One could not ſpeak ſo much as a word, but an Eccho from the Vault of Heaven would repeat it; as if ſhe had a great deſire to learn, or was much in love with that language. Yea all the Mountains which they were ſtill to climb, ſeemed of ſo eaſie aſcent; that they differed nothing from
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:101895:238"/>the plain ground. And the very Trees which grew upon them were ſo ſtraight and tall; that they ſeemed to lift up themſelves above the clouds to beg the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bodies, that they would ſend their pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained influences on them before they had loſt any thing of their innocence, and were defiled by their paſſage thorow our unwholeſome Air to the boſome of the Earth. Many a Mile one might paſs thorow a Forreſt of nothing but Myrtles and Lawrels; under the ſhade of which a Traveller might ſweetly repoſe himſelf, and dream that he ſaw the Crowns and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands which were wreathing for him in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Wood alſo (of which ſome ſtages wholly conſiſted) appeared like a goodly Orchard; where an infinite Variety of lovely fruit ſaluted them that paſſed thorow it. And though the courteous Apples, with all the reſt, ſeemed to bow themſelves to kiſs the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims hands; yet by their fragrancy one would judge that they were not of a meer terreſtrial growth; but fed by ſome inviſible roots above, from which they deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the refined nouriſhment of coeleſtial Juices. From the ſurpluſage of which alſo it was (as one would be tempted to think) that the Balm and all other Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Liquors dropped; which had no other uſe in that place but to annoint the heads of them whom thoſe Trees overſhadowed. In ſhort, this way that he had now to paſs, was called by ſome Poetical fancies the Laughter and Smile of Nature; by others a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly of Pleaſure; by others a World of Sweets that live in fair community together, neither envying nor contemning one the other, but contributing every one to the beauty and delight of the whole. But none of theſe names gave him any ſatisfaction, nor could it pleaſe him to hear it called any thing elſe; than the
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:101895:238"/>
                  <hi>Entrance of the Paradiſe above.</hi> And indeed when he came to taſte of the fruit, he could not but conclude that he eat of the <hi>Tree of Life in the midſt of the Garden of God;</hi> and when he felt thoſe diſtillations on his head, he could think of nothing elſe but the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from above.</hi> All the things in this deſcription were but ſo many Pictures whereby his fancy repreſented to him the happineſs of that life which hereafter he hoped to lead; wherein he thought to find every thing to his deſire. The difficulties of his Journey ſeemed now to be overcome; and every ſtep he ſaw would bring him to a new pleaſure. There was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be done, but what promiſed to gratifie him with repeated joyes, and to reward his labours with abundance of content in the doing of it. And there was nothing to be ſuffered which threatned any harm; but ſeemed to have loſt it prickles and thorns, and to court men into its embraces. Now he thought he ſhould be ſo happy as to live more above, and hold a conſtant communication with Heaven. He expected to ſurmount the clouds wherein he had been wrapped, and to live in a purer light, and enjoy a greater ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of mind. Now he hoped to paſs his time in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limer Meditations; in a ſteadier Faith, in a more ardent Love; in more comfortable Expectations; in quicker taſts of the good things to come; and ſo in more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt. In ſhort, he diſcovered on all ſides both preſent ſatisfactions, and future hopes; with larger Aſſurances alſo that they would not make him aſhamed.</p>
               <p>Being thus then ſpurred by the admonitions of his Friend, and the invitations of the Way, on he went again (together with the happy Companion of his
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:101895:239"/>Travels) ſometimes caſting his eye upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſometimes upon his <hi>Way,</hi> which now became more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and more delightful to him than ever before. But having deſcended a little from the Head of that lofty Hill where they had ſtayed thus long; the young Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim obſerved that he had loſt that fair ſight of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> which he ſo much admired. At which he began to be ſurpriſed with a little quivering and coldneſs in his Body; till his Old Comforter told him that this ought to be the cauſe of no troubleſome thoughts. For the whole way (ſaid he) to that place conſiſts much of Hills and Dales; and as now you are going down from the heights wherein you have been, ſo ſhall you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance again in due time, and be preſented not only with a freſh, but with a fairer ſight of it. He told him alſo how impoſſible it was for any Traveller to remain long upon thoſe Mountains, where the Air is ſo quick and piercing that it would make them quit their earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Manſions. And withall he diſcourſed of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of thoſe Vallies and ſhewed him the Silver Brooks full of the Waters of Life which ran in thoſe humble places; together with all the pretty flowers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the verdant banks of thoſe ſtreams were crowned. In fine he repreſented to him that they were ſo far from deſcending now into any diſmall ſhades; that they were but going to eaſe their minds with a little varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in theſe cool levels, which were almoſt ſpent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled by ſo long a fight of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in thoſe ſuperiour Regions. Not omitting alſo to let him know that it was not ſo impoſſible as he imagined to meet with ſomething of it, in thoſe low Meadows into which they were now entring; which ſpread ſo goodly a Carpet for their feet to tread upon, that the Hill which they had left ſeemed to bow its Head to look
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:101895:239"/>upon the richneſs of it. And thereupon he ſhewed him how thoſe Cryſtal Waters, which he heard murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and inviting his thirſt to quench it ſelf in their ſtreams, came down from a Spring on the brow of that Mountain where they had lately been. And can you believe, ſaid he, that any thing can flow from thence which brings no tydings with it from <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> Taſt and ſee if their relliſh be not ſuch as tells you from whence they come, and makes this place happy which flows with ſuch contentment. Believe not me but your ſelf (if it be not too much for you to ſtoop down and drink) that theſe Vallies are watred from above, and receive at ſecond hand what the more riſing ground at the firſt enjoyes.</p>
               <p>The Young man heard him very obediently and ſoon ſatisfied himſelf in the truth of what he ſaid, by taſting of the Waters, which had a ſtrong tincture of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> For the Rayes that come from it and beat continually upon that aſpiring Hill, had indued the whole body of it with ſome of their Vertue, which might conſtantly be communicated to the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though lower places. He was immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired (I mean) with a great heat of Divine Love, in which he found not a little of Heaven. He ſaw that Meditation, Prayer, and ſuch like holy imployments do but diſpoſe the will to acts of Charity, and doing good to all, according as God hath done to us. The clearer ſight he perceived that any one hath of the Glory to come, the more powerfully is his heart touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a fervent deſire and endeavour to be thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. This is the natural iſſue of a right belief of what Chriſt hath promiſed. There is nothing ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally flows from it when raiſed to its higheſt pitch, as
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:101895:240"/>and eaſineſs and pleaſure in doing good: than which nothing can come nearer to the life of them that dwell above. He ſaw now that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> might be found in the houſes of the ſick, in Hoſpitals, and the meaneſt places where Humility and Charity can find themſelves any work. If he met with a poor Stranger that moved his compaſſion, it was as if he had met with an Angel. If any differences came in his way which he could compoſe, it was as if <hi>Jeſus</hi> had ſpoken peace unto him. When the Orphans and Widows gave him their Bleſſing, it was as if he had received one from Heaven. And all this gave him the greater ſatisfaction, becauſe he was afraid he ſhould have met with it no where elſe, ſave only on ſuch Mountains as they had newly left.</p>
               <p>But yet I muſt not forget to tell you that there was none for whom he felt ſuch a particular kindneſs, as this perſon who had ſo charitably conducted him and made every condition ſo pleaſing to him. He had no ſooner drunk off one Cup of the waters named, and began ſome actions of Charity to others, but he felt himſelf all over in a flame of love to him. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he did, the end of it ſtill was to think how much he was beholden to his love which had directed him to this moſt happy life of doing good. One would have thought by the effects that it had been ſuch a potion as they call a <hi>Philtrum</hi> which hath a power its ſaid to faſcinate Souls; and draw them by a ſweet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment to that party who adminiſters it to them. And to tell you the very truth, had not the wiſdom of his Friend again prevented it, this had proved one of the ſoreſt temptations which he had hitherto en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred; notwithſtanding all the good counſel where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:101895:240"/>with he had been armed. For as he was wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of himſelf, his heart was ſo much glewed to this Friend of his; that ſometimes he could not think of <hi>Jeſus</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> meerly for thinking of him. He thought it was very ſad that any one ſhould be too greedy of ſo innocent a pleaſure; but yet he fancied ſometimes that he was, and that nothing elſe pleaſed him but only the ſociety of this perſon.</p>
               <p>Who now therefore thought himſelf concerned to have a more then ordinary care of his Patient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had made him ſick; or at leaſt been an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his preſent diſeaſe. And ſo quick he was in his Applications, that it could ſcarce be called by that name; but by the Vertue of his remedies was rather turned into a cure of other diſtempers, which had ſome root within him. It is not ſtrange (ſaid the Old man) that I ſhould creep ſo far into your heart, if you do but conſider how wide we open our breaſts to thoſe things which are of great uſe and advantage to us. There was no other cauſe but this that made men Deifie certain Creatures, which they found to be very high benefactors unto them. Have you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard any body call the <hi>Sun</hi> a Viſible God? And what was it I beſeech you that procured him ſo many adorers, but the ſenſe that men had of the benefit of his fires; which enamoured them of his beauty, and inflamed their love to the height of Devotion to him? Wonder not then at your ſelf that you perceive ſuch a fervour in your ſoul to me your poor friend; whom you eſteem (though alas unworthy of ſuch a name) to be no leſs then your Treaſure. This will juſtifie an high degree of affection towards me. And there is no danger I'le warrant you, of proving an
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:101895:241"/>Idolatrous Lover, if you will but let me ſhew you how eaſily you may make me become what you call me; and improve this Affection ſo, as to be a very great gainer by it. But firſt I muſt reveal to you this ſecret, which you have not hitherto diſcovered; that of this affection I my ſelf have a larger ſhare then yet hath appeared; yea, to your own perſon I have not been ſo cold as you may perhaps imagine. And yet I am ſo far from thinking my ſelf, the worſe for what I feel of it, that I take my ſelf to be much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and would not for all the world have a leſs portion of it then I perceive you find in your own heart.</p>
               <p>Now that you may not think I make uſe of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall figures and launch out a great deal beyond the truth; let me beg ſo much of your patience (who as you confeſs have imployed much of mine) till I relate what benefit I have found by loving you. For then I hope you will think it poſſible for your ſelf to reap the ſame: and not be troubled for the exceſs of love you bear to me; ſince thereby you receive no greater hurt, then to become capable of enjoying a more exceeding advantage. And God being the Chiefeſt Good, the higheſt object of our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the ſatisfaction of our Wills, the Centre of all rational deſires; what greater commendation can there be of Friendſhip, than that it is apt to bring our Souls into a fuller poſſeſſion of this Beeing, who is the cauſe of all other, and of all happineſs? Will you not confeſs that it is a thing of great Uſe, and great Value; which ſhall indear him unto you, who is of more uſe and worth then the Sun or all the World? Now if you can give any credit to me, you
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:101895:241"/>may be aſſured that my Friendſhip with you hath taught me not only that God is Love, but what it is to love God, better then any thing elſe perhaps could have done. And what is this Love, but as you have often heard, the whole Duty of man; all that God requires of us that we may enjoy eternal felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with him? This if I can demonſtrate, I ſuppoſe you will no longer complain of an exceſs of this excellent affection, which may ſo eaſily be converted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much Art or contrivance, into one ſo Divine, that that God himſelf will love it very much.</p>
               <p>And if you would know by what Chymiſtry it was that I turned this Baſer affection (as you are apt to call it) into that which is ſo noble and ſublime; it will be a matter of no difficulty to make you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it; for there was no longer operation in it then this. I uſed to obſerve what it was that my love cauſed me to do to you, and that I concluded was farr more due to God. And ſo it taught me (1.) To think often of him and to keep him in Mind; for this I found a neceſſary effect of the Friendſhip I have with you. If there be ſomething in your <hi>Idea</hi> that is grateful to me, which makes me to hugg it ſo much and carry it about with me, then there muſt needs be a great deal more in that <hi>Idea</hi> I have of God, who ought therefore ever to bear me company, and to go along with me as my Joy where ever it be that my occaſions lead me. And ſo (2.) I learnt by loving you, to take a delight in converſing with him, and to embrace or rather ſeek all opportunities of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting his company. And then (3.) (For I muſt not ſtay to enlarge theſe things into long diſcourſes, but leave that for your work) I was inſtructed hereby to deſire his acquaintance more, to thirſt after an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:101895:242"/>familiarity with him, and to be more perfectly united to him. (4.) To be highly pleaſed alſo in him was another fruit of this Amity; To reſt ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in his enjoyment, as to want nothing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat my contentment. And (5.) To ſtudy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al how to be pleaſing to him; or rather to be able without any ſtudy, by a meer likeneſs of Nature, to do all things agreeably to his mind. For I muſt take ſo much liberty by the way as to tell you, that there is no anxious labour in love, nor any carefulneſs to find what is grateful to our Beloved; but we have a natural inclination to do juſt as they would have us. From hence (6.) I proceeded to like well of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever He doth; and to be pleaſed with all his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences. For we alwayes feel our ſelves inclined to find no fault with our Friends, to interpret every thing to the beſt ſenſe; and rather to excuſe that which is ill, then think that they can do it. And (7.) To receive all his kindneſſes with a ſingularly great gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as proceeding only from the goodneſs of his own nature, and not from any deſert of mine. (8.) To keep in Memory alſo his Benefits, and to think of them as I would of the tokens of your love; which I could not but look upon when I did not ſee you. And (9.) as for his Holy word (which one of the Antient Guides uſed to call the <hi>Epiſtle of God to man</hi>) I cannot but read it as I do your Letters, with a great deal of pleaſure and tranſport. And (10.) Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I read it over and overagain, as I am wont to do your Letters; not being content with a ſingle plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; not thinking that I can eſpy all your affection at once that breathes there. And (11.) Do you think that I can live and not long to hear from him, or that I can be ſo patient as not to deſire to ſee him?
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:101895:242"/>No, I am ever ſaying as the holy Pſalmiſt, <hi>O when wilt thou come unto me?</hi> You have taught me to contrive all wayes that I may enjoy him, and to think my ſelf more happy in it, then all the world can make me. And (12.) then I cannot but contrive how I may moſt ſerve him, and be glad of any occaſion which is offered of ſo doing. For you may be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent I ſhould ſuſpect my love, if it did not excite me to render you all the ſervices that are in my power; and make me ſtudy to be able to do that, which is now out of the compaſs of it. And (13.) another thing for which I ſtand indebted to your love, is, that I am taught thereby to be very tender of his Honour, and to be troubled that any body ſhould ſpeak evil of him or do any thing againſt him. Nay (14.) Since you have given me leave to love you, I find that I am deſirous every Body ſhould love him that is ſo ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in my eyes; juſt as I wiſh that you may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to all and never meet with any unkindneſs. (15.) I have learnt alſo to conſult and adviſe with him upon all occaſions, and to open as it were my ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Heart to him. (16.) And then to be confident of his help; and to expect undoubtedly to receive it, whenſoever I have occaſion for it. To which (17.) if I ſhould not add that I have learnt never to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Company, but ſtill to take a freſh delight in it, I ſhould much forget my ſelf; for that is a moſt ſenſible effect of your Friendſhip. And (18.) ſo is this; To be loath to part with it, and to hold him ſo faſt as not to be willing to let him go. As alſo (19.) To be impatient of his abſence, at leaſt not to be ſo well any where elſe as I am with him. And (20.) in fine, To long ever to be with him; and to be put into ſuch a condition that I may never have the
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:101895:243"/>trouble of parting with his company, which alas! in this world I am forced too oft to ſuffer. And you need not wonder that I have learnt this laſt Leſſon by our Friendſhip; for if you and I could now leave theſe pleaſant Plains wherein we are, and ſtrip our ſelves of this fleſh; I formy part would willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto it, if I had aſſurance but of this happineſs; that I ſhould take you by the hand, and we ſhould wander up and down in the Air together.</p>
               <p>I had almoſt forgot to tell you another happy fruit of this paſſion, and that is, when I deſire any thing of him, to leave it to his choice and diſpoſition; knowing that his wiſe Love will do that for me, which is moſt requiſite and conducing to my welfare. Nay, more then this I feel ſuch an inclination to you, that I cannot but be aſhamed if I am not carried with ſuch a Natural affection unto God. I did not begg of my Will to love you, for I was ſurpriſed at firſt ſight with that affection; and felt ſuch a propenſion to you as the Iron doth to the Loadſtone, which cannot chuſe but be raviſhed and attracted by it. From which you may be confident that now it is out of my Power to forbear to love you; and that it is not a buſineſs to be referred to choice, but which Nature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which will not be diſobeyed or controuled. But then me thinks my Soul cannot be ſo dull (finding it ſelf thus diſpoſed to you) as to ſtay to ask it ſelf a reaſon why it ſhould love God; or whether it will love or no. I am forced to love him, and carried to him by ſuch a ſtrong inclination as hath no Cauſe but only Nature. At leaſt, this ſtate I am reaching after; and it ſeems very unhandſome, that I ſhould be ever telling my ſelf that there is this and that cauſe why I
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:101895:243"/>ſhould love God: for I would be ſo impreſſed by him that out of an innate tendency of mind I might run to him; or rather might ſtill be with him and have him continually before mine eyes. I have heard it, I remember, affirmed by ſome, that this Love of Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation comes only from a Reminiſcence, or calling to mind ſuch things as have been before. Such ſouls, ſay they, have been acquainted in ſome other World; and they do not now commence a new love, but only continue an old. And truly if I might judge of the truth of what they ſay by the love I find to God, me-thinks they are not without the countenance of ſome reaſon. For my ſoul ſeems but to renew an antient ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him. My love to him is ſo natural and eaſie, that it is juſt as if once we knew one another before. It doth not ſeem to be the birth of an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which was not, but only the awakening of that which lay aſleep. For there are no pangs, no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in bringing forth this Love; but we open our eyes and ſee that glorious object which our Souls would have, and cannot but faſten themſelves upon.</p>
               <p>And if I ſhould add an heap of obſervations to theſe of another ſort, and ſhow you how hereby we come to be perſwaded of Gods Love to us; and to have ſuch high thoughts of it as to believe he is ready to grant us any thing that we ask, to paſs by our faults, to come and viſit us, to ſend his ſervants the Angels to ſee us, and wait upon us, &amp;c. and all becauſe he is our Friend; you would ſee a further uſe of this divine affection and be convinced that we cannot but live uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably without it. And indeed if any one ſhould think that it is put into our Souls for ſo poor an End as to tickle us with a little pleaſure in civil converſation, and
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:101895:244"/>to help us to paſs away the time more merrily, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to theſe Heavenly uſes; it would be as abſurd a conceit, as to imagine the Sun was made for no other purpoſe but to colour the cheeks of our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and enlarge the Sphaere of our Cabbages. No, nature will not let us depreſs ſo far this darling of hers, to which ſhe is inclined above all other things. That muſt needs be implanted by the hand of God to which all men have a propenſity; and ſince it is very ſtrong, overweighing all other inclinations; we muſt needs think that it was planted in them to do them ſome great benefit, and to be the inſtrument above all other things of their happineſs. Now what is there to which we have a more imbred inclination, then to love and to deſire to be beloved? There is no man but hates to be alone, and can as little indure to be with thoſe for whom he hath no love. For ſtill he is alone, if that be not there. A crowd is not company; (as a Wiſe man ſayes) and Faces are but a Gallery of Pictures; and Talk but a Tinkling Cymbal, where there is no love. Nay ſo natural is this to us (and withall ſo ſweet) that I believe there is no man in the World who for all the wealth in it, would be bound to love no body and to be beloved of none.</p>
               <p>He was going on to ſome further diſcourſes on this ſubject, when the other cryed out, Hold, do not wholly impoveriſh this argument, but leave ſomething for me to ſay, who am abundantly ſatisfied that there is nothing comparable to this which hath been the cauſe of my trouble. I will never blame my ſelf more for exceeding too much in this ſort of love. I plainly ſee that Mediocrity, which every where elſe is counted a Vertue, doth here become a Vice. I am more then
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:101895:244"/>converted by your excellent diſcourſe. I muſt turn Proſelyte to him who ſaid, <hi>That he would have the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Friends appear rather a Paſſion then a Vertue: That Friendſhip hath nothing more excellent in it then exceſs: and that it doth rather offend in the Moderation, then in its Violence and extremity.</hi> And here he began to invent all the Praiſes he could of Friendſhip, which he called, The top and perfection of Love; the Soul of the World; the Spirit of Nature; the bond of Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the marriage and happy union of agreeing minds; the life and joy of mankind; the relief of our ſorrows; the Phyſitian of all our ſecret griefs; our Buckler in all aſſaults; our Oracle in our doubts; the Governor and Tutor of a proſperous condition; the Comforter of a declining fortune; without which the greateſt happineſs would be irkſome to us; and in whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the greateſt affliction cannot make us miſerable. He reflected alſo very happily on this; that it was one of the laſt things that <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf did in this world, to make a Friendſhip between two great perſons, his bleſſed Mother, and his beloved Diſciple. Theſe he remembred our Lord would have to live together like Mother and Son; which he thought imported ſuch a dearneſs between them, as would juſtifie the height of his affection. And then he cryed out, Thou O Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love, art the nature of God, the life of Angels, the employment of Heaven! By knowing thee I know what it is that I owe to God; and I now alſo know <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> better, where they exerciſe the Nobleſt Friendſhips. I will never fear thee any more; for I ſee thou wilt ſecure my duty to God, and it will be ſtrange if my Neighbours be not better for thee, who art alwayes inſtigating me to do good. What though I be chained more to one perſon then another; you
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:101895:245"/>need not think, O ſons of men, that I ſhall thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come leſs charitable to you: For my love finding here a continual employment and conſtant exerciſe for it ſelf; I am the more diſpoſed and ready when occaſion ſerves to expreſs it to you all. My retirements can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not work its decay; but in the greateſt privacy this friendſhip keeps any ruſt from growing over it, and preſerves it pure and bright for the uſe of others too. I love you all whereſoever you dwell on the face of the whole earth. I ſtretch out my hands to you from one Pole to the other; wiſhing I could do you good. And though I cannot reach you every one; yet my love gives me the comfort of this aſſurance, that God is with you; who as he hath a greater love ſo a greater abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to help you all.</p>
               <p>But his Guide who was better acquainted with his duty then himſelf, thought it beſt to bring him out of this Rapture; becauſe he ſaw that he would immerſe himſelf too far in the pleaſure of this contemplation; and likewiſe thought it was not ſafe to gratifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with too much of this Honey at once. He pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him therefore to lay aſide this diſcourſe a while and to divert himſelf with the obſervation of ſome of thoſe flowers and plants wherewith they ſaw the earth ſtrewed as they went along. For ſure, ſaid he, theſe were not made for us to tread upon, nor only to feed our eyes with their grateful Variety, or to bring a ſweet odor to our Noſes; but there is a more internal beauty in them for our minds to prey upon; did we but let them penetrate beyond the ſurface of theſe things into their hidden properties. You are a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian it is confeſſed, but doth that make you ceaſe to be a Man? You read the Goſpel of our Saviour, but
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:101895:245"/>muſt that give a diſcharge to all our rational inquiries into the Book of Nature? Doth the new Creation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to deſtroy the old? Or becauſe we behold God in the face of Chriſt muſt we look upon him no where elſe? No ſuch matter; there is a more antient obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon you to ſtudy the Works of God; of which you ought to quit your ſelf while you ſtudy his Word. It is an honour to the School of Chriſt, when his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are ſkill'd in all Wiſdom. He is ſuch a Maſter as would not have us know other things the leſs, but the more, by knowing him. And ſo they began to pry into many curioſities, which ſeveral of the Creatures they met withall preſented to them; not without a great aſtoniſhment at that infinite underſtanding that was the Contriver of them. And having once taſted of this kind of Learning, he often wiſhed that it was in his power to underſtand more of his own Body; of the motions of the Sun, Moon and other Stars; with many things beſides in this great Fabrick; wherein he knew God had hid great treaſures of Wiſdom, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven a fair Image of himſelf. Yea, he conceived the whole World ſometimes a great Temple, and himſelf one of the Prieſts that God had placed therein to offer up the Praiſes of all the Creatures, and acknowledge his Wiſdom, his Power, his Goodneſs; which are conſpicuous in the frame of them. And though he could acquire but a very ſmall knowledge of ſome of them; yet it was a great pleaſure to ſee that there were many more intelligent Prieſts then himſelf and more acquainted with Natures Myſteries; who ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to God continually better Praiſes, and called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all his works in all places of his Dominion to bleſs his Holy name.</p>

               <p>No, ſaid his companion? Nothing at all? That is very ſtrange indeed and you muſt pardon me if I tell you that it is a melancholy conceit. For have you overcome ſo many temptations and yet done nothing? Do you love God and your neighbour ſo much as to have an infinite deſire of doing good and yet not at all bettered?

               <p>With much ado he perſwaded him to conſent to this motion, and though thereby he received ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, yet the ſame dejected humor too much continued.

Beſides the continuance therefore of that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and the uſe of ſome Phyſick; he thought good at ſeaſonable times more particularly to remember all that the Gratious God had done for him. Bidding him to take great heed leſt under the guiſe of this Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility (as it is eſteemed) he proved unthankful for his
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:101895:247"/>favours; and by ſtudying to depreſs himſelf, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all depreſſed the bounty of his goodneſs. He let him know alſo that the perfection which he aimed at (the want whereof might poſſibly be the root of this new trouble) was not to be attained by ſuch violent, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate and impetuous motions, but by leiſurely, quiet and ſilent ſteps unto it. Did you mind, ſaid he, the flowers as we paſſed along, how ſome were hidden in their green Cups; others were half-born; and the reſt newly diſcloſed? Or have you never marked the Roſe how it ſwells into ſmall knobs or buttons; which when they are full grown, do rive by little and little until they have diſcovered all their treaſures? Suppoſe you ſhould unbutton it as ſoon as it ſwells, or go about ſuddenly to rip it up when it is opening it ſelf, would you not endanger the ſpoiling of its beauties, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive your ſelf of that wholly, which you deſire too ſoon to enjoy? Your own caſe is nothing different; and if you will not be content to grow leiſurely, you may miſs of the happineſs at which you would ſo ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily arrive. You muſt not make ſo much haſte as I have often told you. You muſt give your ſelf leave to ripen; and allow a fair time for your proceeding to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And in the mean ſeaſon be not ſo unreaſonable as to think you have nothing, becauſe you have not all that is in your deſires. It may ſeem ſtrange perhaps at firſt ſight, but it is certainly true; that the deſire of much Vertue may prove inordinate. Though you may think that it can never be too paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately purſued; yet aſſure your ſelf, your deſires are undue, when ſuch an affliction of ſpirit attends upon them, as is wont to accompany the deſire of other things. If the violence and fierceneſs of them rend your heart; there may be as much hazard in it, as
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:101895:247"/>there is in tearing up a Roſe when it is in labour to bring forth its leaves. That is, you will never be ſo good as other wayes you might; nor obtain ſo much by your own eagerneſs as would come of it ſelf in a courſe of nature. I do not intend to quench your Zeal, nor is all this ſaid to make you leſs fervent in your ſtudy to become more pious; or to move you to leave all to Gods Will without your own induſtry. But my meaning is, that juſt as you take order in your worldly affairs, ſo ſhould you manage your ſelf in thoſe of your Soul. We muſt be diligent in the purſuit of ſuch things as are needful for our Bodies; yet we ought not to afflict our ſelves with the anguiſh of cares and fears, and ſuch like paſſions; but quietly put the iſſue of our labours into Gods hands, and patiently expect what he will bleſs them withall. Even ſo muſt you beſtir your ſelf with as much induſtry as you can for the good of your Soul; yet with this condition that if you cannot acquire all that you would, you do not ſuffer your heart to fall into a fit of impatience, vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and fretting at your preſent eſtate; which muſt needs be joyned with a great diſtruſt of God. By this means while you would avoid one fault, you run into another. And you keep your ſelf with ſuch violent hands from compaſſing your deſires, that you ſeek for Perfection by the means of the greateſt Imperfection; and would redreſs your diſorders by conſtantly living in them. You muſt thank God therefore for what he gives, and patiently wait upon him for more when he pleaſes to beſtow it. And I am apt to think that <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> in the company of our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections when we do our beſt indeavour to out-grow them; is as acceptable to God as the nobler Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of others that complain of no ſuch imperfections.
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:101895:248"/>For the one is the Gift of God as well as the other; and he that gives them to be without ſuch defects, gives you Grace to bear them meekly when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be helpt.</p>
               <p>I would have you, my Friend, not to ceaſe to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the braveſt Examples; and when you cannot be Maſter of all you deſire, yet ſtill to continue your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. But be not diſguſted at your ſelf, I beſeech you, that you are in a ſtate of deſire, and not of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect enjoyment. Let not this take away your peace, that you are not in the foremoſt ranks of thoſe that are marching to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Be not caſt down and ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicted within your ſelf, that you do not advance ſo faſt as you would. Do not follow your Saviour with a ſowre heart, dejected looks, and faln wings, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are wont to do; who perpetually lament their faults, and cannot yet amend them. But render him moſt humble thanks that he hath given you the knowledge of them, and an earneſt longing to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, and a ſtudy to ſhake them off; together with good hopes that they may be cured; or that as ſome go to Heaven in the height of Vertue, ſo others may accompany them with as much as they could poſſibly attain. All have not the ſame Temper, the ſame Diverſions, nor the ſame Buſineſſes in the World; and therefore be content with that degree which your condition will permit you to riſe unto, and reſolve not to vex your ſelf unreaſonably about that which is not in your power to remedy. You have often heard, I believe, that there is no Peace to be had here but by Patience. And in my opinion he ſaid true who told one of his Diſciples; That it is no Patience when a man is content to bear with his neighbour, if withall he be
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:101895:248"/>not content to bear with himſelf. Not to the end (as I told you) that he ſhould indulge himſelf in idleneſs, and not ſtrive to grow better; but that all the pains he takes to be ſo, ſhould not end in ſorer pains and greater torments becauſe he is yet no better.</p>
               <p>Many other things he added to the ſame effect; and at laſt prayed him, that if he was faln into ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of himſelf as to be weary of long diſcourſes as well as of his condition; yet at leaſt he would obſerve theſe three things, not unworthy of his notice, though they were the advice of Heathens. <hi>Hecaton</hi> hath this ſaying. Aſkeſt thou wherein I have profited? <hi>I have begun to be a friend to my ſelf.</hi> Such a man hath gotten very much. He will never be alone, but alwayes hath a good Companion with him. And he that is a friend to himſelf, will not fail to be a friend to every body elſe. I believe you cannot deny, that you might have made this Anſwer to the ſame Queſtion. You have begun to take a great care of your Soul. Nay, you have a long time made it your buſineſs to do it good. And if you aſk other men, they will tell you; that you are a friend to them, and have done them alſo a great deal of good. How came you to grow into this fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with your Soul? What made you to let it have ſo much of your company? ſure it is a ſign of ſome proficiency that you are ſo well acquainted with it. And this brings to my mind another mark of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in Vertue which is viſible even in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. <hi>It is an argument</hi> (ſaith <hi>Seneca</hi>) <hi>of a mind that is changed for the better; when it is acquainted with thoſe faults which it was ignorant of before.</hi> To which I may add a <hi>third.</hi> Do you not will and will alway the ſame things? Are not thoſe things the matter of
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:101895:249"/>your choice to day, which yeſterday you deſired? <hi>This is a teſtimony of your profiting, to be conſtant to your ſelf.</hi> And therefore take heed I beſeech you of this ſowre loathing of your ſelf; for in time it will breed a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of your duty too, and ſpoil your appetite to any thing that is good. While you are inordinately troubled that you cannot do as you would, you will not do what you can. And in a multitude of confuſed deſires after a better condition; you will waſte the time which ought to be ſpent in doing your beſt in your preſent eſtate.</p>
               <p>With theſe good Counſels and other Remedies too long to be related, he recovered the poor man to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtate of health; and brought him to conceive a better opinion of himſelf. And yet his health was not ſo confirm'd, but that afterward he fell into a little diſtemper, and languiſhed under a new trouble; very near of kin to this, and which it brings to my mind. It was a great deſpondency ariſing from the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome weakneſſes he felt in his Soul, which bred in him a diffidence and diſtuſt of his own conſtancy; and a fear that he ſhould never hold out in his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but at laſt ſit down ſhort of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> This madet him exceeding penſive, and to go drooping a gread while; becauſe he thought that every mile would prove his laſt; or at leaſt that he ſhould never be able to travel ſo long till he had finiſhed his courſe. Which jealouſie diſcovering it ſelf by ſome means or other unto his friend (though he did what he could to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it) He was moved with a great deal of pitty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. And beſeeched him earneſtly not to let every ſuſpition of himſelf which ſtarted up in his Soul, make ſuch a deep impreſſion there; before he
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:101895:249"/>had adviſed whether there were cauſe to entertain it or no. For if you had aſked me about this matter as ſoon as you moved the doubt, I could ſoon have made you give your ſelf ſatisfaction; and laid ſuch a ſcene of new thoughts in your mind, that you ſhould have remembred the former no more. For, tell me, I pray you, who brought you thus far in this long Journey wherein you are engaged? Was it your ſelf; or was it ſome body elſe? If it was your ſelf, you know upon what reaſons it was begun; and if they were worth any thing, they may make you to go on. And it ſhould ſeem alſo that you have more ſtrength than you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, if you have travelled ſo many leagues, without any ſupport; upon your own leggs. But I perceive you ſo ill opinionated of your ſelf, that you are incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by that if there were no other reaſon; to aſcribe your happy progreſs to ſome higher cauſe. Thither let us go then; and aſk of God, if he uſes to forſake the work of his own hands; and to loſe all that he hath done already, for want of doing a little more. Will he now forſake you, after you have ſerved him ſo many years? Will he diſown one that hath been ſo long a Client to him, and ſtill ſeeks for his wonted protection? Doth he love his Friends no better, than to ſhake them off when they grow old. If I would at all have ſuſpected his Conſtancy, it ſhould have been in the beginning of our acquaintance; and not now that he hath been tryed for half an Age. Was there any reaſon at firſt why he ſhould bear a good will to you, or was there none? If there was none, then there needs none to move him now to continue his Love. If there was any, then there is a greater reaſon now; becauſe he hath loved you ſo long, and you are alſo more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy his Love. Do him the honour then that you
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:101895:250"/>would do a friend, to believe that he is not fickle and inconſtant. Or do but juſtice to him, and think that he is not unfaithful, but true to his word. And then as long as your Lord lives, you ſhall live alſo. And he that hath begun a good work in you, will perfect it no doubt till he come to give you his rewards.</p>
               <p>I know you will tell me that you do not queſtion his faithfulneſs and ſtedfaſtneſs to his friends; but you have been unkind to him, and ſo have forfeited his good eſteem and Love. And let it be ſo, ſince it is your pleaſure; that you have not behaved your ſelf ſo gratefully as you ought: But is he of ſuch a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he can never be won to a Reconciliation? I pray have a care what you ſay, for fear you make good men better than God; who are wont to forgive their Brother when he repents, not only ſeven times, but ſeventy times ſeven. And, ſay I beſeech you, hath he not pardoned you heretofore very lovingly when you humbly and obediently intreated him to paſs by your offences? When you were one of the World, did he not then draw you to himſelf without your deſire; and over-matched your ſins by his infinite, omnipotent Goodneſs? What ſhould hinder then his kindneſs and clemency towards you, now that you are become a man ſeparate from the World? If the Mire and Dirt wherein we wallowed could not hinder, but he would needs take us in his arms, and place us in his boſome; will he ſhake us off and throw us out from thence, now that we are waſhed and made clean? Will he not rather wipe off a ſpeck of Dirt that hath light upon us, than caſt us down into the Mire again? Can you think that he who took in ſtrangers to his houſe, and gave them kind entertainment; will turn
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:101895:250"/>his Children out of doors? After we have done him ſo many ſervices, and laboured for his Love; will he thruſt us out in an heat of anger, and quite caſheere us his family? O abſurd ſuſpition! A jealouſie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of ſuch an excellent Father, and unbecoming Sons that have ſo nobly and tenderly been brought up by him. If you were to treat with a perſon like your ſelf, you muſt firſt think him very bad; or elſe you would not be ſo injurious as to harbour ſuch thoughts of him. You muſt judge him very froward, who will fall out with you upon every ſleight occaſion; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver return with you into grace any more. Do not impute then a thing ſo unnatural unto God; nor ſo much wrong his infinite Goodneſs, as to take Him to be of ſo harſh a diſpoſition; that we muſt never expect his favour more, if we chance but to offend him. No, if you can but believe that he loves himſelf, you need not fear that he ſhould thus abandon you. You have coſt him too much, that he ſhould ſo eaſily part with you. He hath bought you at ſo exceſſive a rate; that you may be aſſured he will not willingly loſe you. The breeding of you hath ſtood him in ſo much care; that he will not ſpare a little more to keep you.</p>
               <p>And if you are thus ſecure of God's Love, I pray tell me what you think ſhould ſeparate you from him? Can you really think that you your ſelf ſhall have a mind to leave him, and return back to the World from whence you came? You cannot I am confident remain two minutes in this perſwaſion, if you be not forſaken of your Reaſon, and left to the impoſtures of Fancy and wild Imagination. For what is that can diſſolve that league of Friendſhip that is
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:101895:251"/>ſo ſolemnly and religiouſly ſworn betwixt you? Is there any thing in him that can diſguſt you, and make him ſeem leſs amiable in your eyes? Can you fear that his converſation may grow tedious, and prove a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to you in the concluſion? or what prejudice can you receive by loving of him; ſeeing you believe that All Good is in him, and that he calls us to his own Kingdom and Glory? I am verily perſwaded you think that you cannot ceaſe to love me, to whom you profeſs your ſelf ſo much beholden. And yet what am I in compare with Him; or what obligations have you received from me that can be ſo ſtrong to hold you, as thoſe that he hath laid upon you? I may change and not be ſo good as I am; or not ſo full of love to you. Some damage may appear that you may be in danger to receive by loving me; which I can never be able to repair. But there is not ſo much as a ſhadow of turning in him. He is alwayes the ſame Fulneſs, and the ſame Love; infinitely deſirous of our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And as for any loſs that we may poſſibly ſuſtain for his ſake; it cannot be ſo great, but he can make us a recompence for it incomparably greater. Do not hold your ſelf then in ſuch ſuſpition, unleſs you can think that you have taken a wrong meaſure of him: eſpecially ſince you are of opinion that you cannot but love me to the end; and alſo have ſo lately told me that you was ſatisfied the love of me would teach you to love God the better.</p>
               <p>I ſhould proceed to remember you alſo that the wayes of Vertue which you have to tread are ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, that you will not be inclined to relinquiſh them and divert into any other path: and that you can never think ſit ſo to diſparage this noble life, as to
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:101895:251"/>leave it after you have made a very long trial of it: and that you will not endure to retreat with ſo much ſhame as you will neceſſarily draw upon your ſelf, by abandoning a courſe which you have ſo highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended: All this I ſay and much more I ſhould call to your mind but that you ſeem to diſcharge me of that trouble by the chearfulneſs which I obſerve to return into your countenance. I ſee that you begin to believe that you ſhall perſevere; and that you reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your antient comfort; That ſtronger is he who dwelleth in you, then he who dwelleth in the world. The Devil begins already to fly from you; and by the light of theſe truths we have chaſed away the cloud that hung over you. Carry them therefore I intreat you ever in your mind; and let me hear no more of theſe dejections of ſpirit, which are as unreaſonable as they are uncomfortable both to your ſelf and others. I'le ſay no more of this matter, after I have told you a ſtory of an antient Pilgrim in the way to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> to which therefore you had beſt attend. It is St. <hi>Peter</hi> I mean, who you know had a mind to walk with our Saviour upon the water; which was no eaſie thing to do: and yet by the power of his Maſter was indued with ſuch a vertue as to tread ſafely upon that yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing element. He went a pretty way while the face of the water was ſmooth and even; and it ſeemed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing different from the ſolid earth. Untill the wind began to be loud, and the plain way upon the water was turned into Hills and Dales, we hear of no ſhrikes; but then he cryed out and his heart and his feet began to ſink together. But was there any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear drowning after he had walked half a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long? or to imagine it would not bear him up the next half as well as it had done the former? none at
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:101895:252"/>all ſure. The winds that blew, and the rough waves that began to lift up themſelves; were no leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to that power which upheld him, then the ſmooth and quiet ſurface of the Sea. It was as eaſie to walk upon a Billow, as upon the ſtill water. The bluſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wind had no more power there, then the ſilent Aire. Whence then proceeded this change, that the man who lately trampled upon the Sea and gloried over the deep; doth now feel himſelf ſlip into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of it, and is in danger to be ſwallowed up by it. The firm ground which he thought was under him, is gone; and he is left to the mercy of the angry waves. Was not the change within before his feet felt any? Did not a violent fear lay hold upon him; and did he not let go his hold of the hand which before ſuſtained him? Yes, this was the buſineſs. If his Faith had been as ſtrong as once it was, his condition had been as ſafe in the midſt of the ſtorm, as before it was in the calm. When this Anchor broke, the waters began to ſuck him in. They challenged him then for their proper goods; becauſe his Faith was in a manner already ſhipwrackt: But did his Gratious Maſter ſo part with him? Would he loſe a ſervant becauſe he was weak, and wanted confidence in him? Or did he delay to help him and only hold him up by the chin when all his body was in the deep? No; when he cryed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and beſeeched to be ſaved, he inſtantly put forth his hand, caught hold of him and reſcued him from the jaws of death. He only chides him becauſe he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but neither lets him ſink into the belly of the waters; nor ſtayes his ſuccours till he was in greater need of them. He ſtraightway lends him more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; and chuſes rather to incourage a little Faith, then let him periſh becauſe he had no more.</p>
               <pb n="487" facs="tcp:101895:252"/>
               <p>Now this ſtory methinks bears a great reſemblance with that condition wherein you and many more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides have been. We have a great mind to go to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> and for that end to walk here in the World as he walked. But it is very much that we who are ſo earthly and have ſuch ponderous affections to things here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſhould be able to tread them under our feet; and keep our ſelves above the ſoft pleaſures of the fleſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which we are apt to ſink. This ſeems no leſs a wonder, then it was for a body of earth to walk upon the face of the Sea, which uſes to ſwallow down ſuch heavy things that come into it. Whence is it I pray that we have this ſtrength, and can lift up our ſelves above our natural propenſions to lead the life of God? Is it from our own Vertue? or rather muſt we not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that we receive it from that voice which ſaith to us as unto that Apoſtle of our Lord, <hi>Come?</hi> This ſure is the cauſe to which it muſt be aſcribed. And it cannot be of leſs efficacy afterward, then it was at the firſt; but when he ſtill ſaith, <hi>Follow me,</hi> he gives a greater power and force unto us ſo to do. But how comes it about then that you and others begin ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſink; or at leaſt to imagine that you are falling into the World; and that the ſenſual life will at laſt draw you into its embraces again? Truly, there is the ſame cauſe of it, that there was in him; and that is <hi>Diffidence.</hi> You forget your ſelf and diſtruſt God; and that works a decay of the Vertue and ability that was in your heart. You regard more the winds and the waves, the difficulties and temptations that you are incompaſſed withall, then the power and the love of <hi>Jeſus</hi> which attends upon you; and ſo you begin firſt to fear and then to fall. Yet behold what a loving and kind Maſter you ſerve. He doth not take this ſo
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:101895:253"/>ill at your hands as to let you quite go; and fall ſtill lower and lower into the water, untill you be drown'd: But if you look earneſtly upon him and call to him, and intreat him to take pitty upon you and not to leave you; he gives you his hand preſently and ſets you in ſafety. Though now you have been very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful of his goodneſs; and have fainted in your mind as if he would not regard you; yet his tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſo great that he bids me aſſure you he will not forſake you; nor fail to ſupport and help your feeble ſoul. Only in his name I muſt a little chide you; and give you a gentle reproof in his own words, ſaying, <hi>O thou of little faith, wherefore didſt thou doubt?</hi> I ſay no more, becauſe I ſee you are ſorrowful and hope you will give me no more the like trouble.</p>
               <p>Indeed replyed the <hi>Pilgrim</hi> I deſerve a more ſevere reprehenſion, and you deal too favourably with me when you give me ſo mild a rebuke. But I ſuppoſe you uſe me thus tenderly that I may be ſenſible of the gratious nature of our Lord; who hath compaſſion on our weakneſs and is loath to diſcourage thoſe by any ſharpneſs of his, who are too apt to invent over many diſcouragements to themſelves. And truly I am ſo apprehenſive of his lenity and behold alſo ſo great a portion of it in your ſelf; that were it not upon that account, I ſhould again be apt to ſtand in fear of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting not only you but him a greater trouble then you are able to bear. I am you ſee very fooliſh, alwayes complaining and exerciſing your patience. I have ſo many ſcruples and little fears; am ſo unconſtant and wavering in my thoughts; ſo frequently ſick and out of order; ſo forgetful alſo of your counſels; that perhaps by this time you begin to reflect and conſider
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:101895:253"/>how great a burden you have drawn upon your ſelf by undertaking the charge of me. And I pray tell me ſincerely whether you are not a little weary of me, and do not wiſh your ſelf rid of ſuch an impediment; for I can ſcarce call my ſelf your <hi>Friend</hi> any longer, but your <hi>Trouble</hi> or your <hi>Burden.</hi> Tell me I ſay, is not this a fitter name for me then any elſe? And can you find in your heart to own that ſweet relation to him any more; who hath made himſelf ſo unpleaſing on all occaſions, and nothing but diſquieted your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py repoſe? I doubt if you could ſee my heart, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what a ſeed of new troubles and doubts lodges there; you would tell me plainly that you ſhall never enjoy your ſelf till you be divorced from me.</p>
               <p>You ſurpriſe me ſtrangely, ſaid the Good old man, and did I not conſider that you have ſuſpected the kindneſs of God himſelf I ſhould be ſo amazed at this alteration in you as to loſe the uſe of words and not know what to ſay to you. Little did I think that I ſhould ever have had an occaſion to anſwer ſuch a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion as that you propoſe; for ſure you never diſcerned that I had a mind to be ſeparated from you. And truly I never diſcerned any ſuch thing in my ſelf; nor have you given me cauſe to be leſs your Friend then heretofore; unleſs it be by this unfriendly jealouſie, which as I told you a little while ago I thought you would never have entertained. And ſince I ſee it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds rather from an ill opinion of your ſelf, then any you have of me I recall that word; and pray you to believe that you are as dear unto me as ever; that is my friend. And what I pray you is the office of a friend, if not to relieve the wants of thoſe he loves; and to bear thoſe burdens with them which they are not able
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:101895:254"/>to carry alone? If they themſelves therefore by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of any heavineſs of Spirit, prove the burden that he muſt ſuſtain, He will not complain of it. It is their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs he knows both that they are ſo heavy, and are in danger they think to be a load to him; and He will not let them be more unhappy, by becoming heavy himſelf, and groaning under that eaſie weight which they lay upon him. Eaſie I call it, becauſe it is a pleaſure to do any kindneſs for our friends; and the pleaſure encreaſes proportionably to the pains that we take in doing of it. You ſhall hear the Judgement of a Philoſpher in this caſe if you pleaſe; and of one that loved eaſe more then any of his fellows. Though a wiſe man he thought might be content with himſelf; yet notwithſtanding he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that his happineſs would be greater with a friend. Of ſuch a companion he cannot but be deſirous, if it be for no other end, but to exerciſe his amity; and that ſo great a vertue may not remain without uſe. <hi>He doth not chuſe a friend</hi> (<hi>ſaith</hi> Epicurus <hi>himſelf</hi>) <hi>to have ſome to aſſiſt him when he is ſick, or to ſuccour him if he be in priſon, or ſuch neceſſities. But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wiſe, that he may have one whom he may help and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the like diſtreſſes. For he hath an evil intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that only reſpects himſelf when he makes Friendſhip. And ſo ſhall he end his friendſhip as he begun the ſame. He that hath purchaſed himſelf a friend to the intent that he may be ſuccoured by him in priſon; will take his flight as ſoon as he feels that he is releaſed of his bonds. Both the chains ſhall be knockt off together, thoſe of his priſon and thoſe of his friendſhip. Theſe are the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips which we vulgarly call Temporary, being made only to ſerve a turn. He that is made a friend for profit ſake, ſhall pleaſe as long as he may be profitable; and ſo
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:101895:254"/>they who are in felicity ſee themſelves inviron'd with a multitude of theſe followers; But where the diſtreſſed dwell, there is nothing but ſolitude. For ſuch manner of friends alwayes avoid thoſe places where they may be proved. It is neceſſary that the beginning and the end have a correſpondence. He that hath begun to be a friend becauſe it is expedient; he that hath thought there is a gain in friendſhip beſide it ſelf; may well be ſuborn'd againſt the ſame by the appearance and offers of a greater gain. For what cauſe then do I entertain a friend? To the end I may have one for whom I may dye; whom I may accompany in baniſhment, and for whoſe life and preſervation I may expoſe my ſelf to any danger. For the other, which only regards profit and makes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that which may turn to its own commodity; it is rather a Traffique then Friendſhip. Certain it is that Friendſhip hath in ſome ſort a ſimilitude and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the affection of Lovers. Whoſe ſcope is neither gain, nor greatneſs, nor glory; but deſpiſing all other conſiderations, love it ſelf inkindles in them a deſire of the beloved form, under hopes of a mutual and reciprocal amity.</hi> Thus he.</p>
               <p>Unleſs you will number me then among thoſe <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer friends</hi> which he ſpeaks of; or think that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in me is feebler then it was in Pagans; you muſt not hold me any longer in ſuſpition. And indeed if you did but know how great a favour you do me, in letting me know your griefs, and making me the Witneſs of your Conſcience, and relying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me for advice, and thereby giving me an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſerve you the beſt I can; you would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently throw away all theſe Imaginations which the enemy of Souls, and of Friendſhip would inſtill into
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:101895:255"/>you. For my part, I did not ſo lightly and in ſport receive you into my conduct; as that any difficulty or a multitude of them ſhould make my employment tedious to me. Nay, how can it be irkſome; when you your ſelf acknowledge that the labours of Love are all pleaſure, and carry their own rewards in them. You may think perhaps that love grows old as well as all other things, and that time works its decay and renders it feeble and weak. Thus <hi>Attalus</hi> was wont to ſay that it is far more pleaſant to make a friend, then to have one. As it is more agreeable to a Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters fancy, to draw his lines, then to have finiſhed the picture. After he hath painted indeed he poſſeſſes the fruit of his Art, but he took pleaſure in the Art it ſelf when he painted. Juſt as the youth of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is more fruitful to us, but their infancy is more ſweet. But aſſure your ſelf I do not live by any of theſe Maxims. Friendſhip is like Wine; the older it is the better. It grows more pure by age; its ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are more diſingaged; and it warms the heart more powerfully then when it was but new and green. Nay, your friendſhip is more pleaſant too, whatſoever you may think; now that it is grown; then it was in its childhood. I enjoy the remembrance of thoſe pleaſures and have ſome new ones beſides: juſt as a Painter thinks on his Art when he beholds the piece that he hath brought to perfection. I beſeech you then if you have any love to me that you will not call in queſtion mine to you. And if all this will not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie you; let me intreat you for the Love of our Lord, that you will aſk him whether I do not love you. I know he is ſo much a friend to Truth and unto Love too (not to ſay to you and me) that he will do me the favour to perſwade you that I do. And
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:101895:255"/>therefore let not the Evil one who loves nothing leſs then our Friendſhip, ſow this jealouſie in your heart that I grow weary of you. But be confident that as our Lord loves you, ſo he imparts true love to me; and that if the armes of theſe two can do any thing, you ſhall be carried ſafe to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now ſince I have told you my very heart, let me know I pray what further doubt it is that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles yours. It cannot be ſo great ſure that I ſhould not find a remedy for it: and you need not fear that it will procure me too great a trouble; ſince it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as you ſee one of my chief pleaſures to eaſe you of your troubles. It muſt be ſo indeed ſaid the <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim</hi> if you have any pleaſure at all: For I live as if I had nothing elſe to do but to find ſome new occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to perplex my ſelf, that I may be diſintangled by you. You think that I am advanced a great way toward <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and truly I hope that I am gone fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then I lately thought my ſelf. But alas I am no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo ſtrong, ſo ſteady, much leſs ſo wiſe as you ſeem ſometimes to imagine. A little thing you ſee ſhakes me; and there are leſſer matters that you have not yet been privy to that put my thoughts into confuſion. The very puff of a confident mans breath doth indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to make me reel. And though I underſtand my ſelf very well in thoſe things wherein you have inſtructed me, yet the meer zeal and earneſtneſs wherewith ſome perſons aſſault me, when there is no reaſon in what they ſay; is apt to make me ſuſpect and diſtruſt my ſelf, nay to fall into a trembling leſt all ſhould not be well with me. This you will ſay is a ſmall matter and not worthy to be called a trouble; (and truly I am glad
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:101895:256"/>and thank God for your ſake that it is no more) yet when I give you an inſtance of it, you will think I had ſome cauſe to complain as I did; though not ſo much as my words in the late paſſion wherein I was, might import. Your diſcourſe of <hi>Faith</hi> and Confidence in God (for which I am obliged unto you) revived at firſt the memory of my weakneſs inſtead of giving me ſtrength; and made me think with my ſelf, Alas! I have made it a Queſtion whether I have any Faith or no. For to tell you the truth, I met lately with an acquaintance of mine (when you were abſent about ſome buſineſs) who would needs perſwade me that I was drawn away, and was no true Believer; becauſe I deſcribed Faith unto him in that manner as you had taught me. I told him that I was heartily perſwaded that Jeſus was the Son of God; and that he had taught us all his Will; and that he having dyed for our ſins, did by the ſame death confirm unto us great and precious promiſes; and that he lives and raigns in Heaven for ever; and that he will give eternal life to all that obey him; and that hereupon I was become obedient to his voice, and quitting all preſent enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, was willing to follow him to the death. And yet after all this he miſ-called my Perſwaſion by a word which I think he did not underſtand; ſaying that I was indued only with an <hi>Hiſtorical Faith</hi> which would not ſave me. I explained that word as well as I could, and told him that a belief of the Hiſtory of the Goſpel (of all that is related there) when it produces obedience to the Laws of it, was Saving Faith. But he ſmiled at my ignorance; (as he eſteemed it) and told me that the Faith which juſtifies, and ſo ſaves us, was only a <hi>recumbency on Chriſt;</hi> an <hi>application of his merits to my Soul;</hi> with a number of ſuch like phraſes:
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:101895:256"/>the obſcurity or lameneſs, or danger of which, though I repreſented to him, yet would he not yield a jot; nor ceaſe to importune me that I would take heed of the danger of unbelief. And indeed I knowing him to be a good man himſelf; and he affirming that all godly men of a long time had been of his mind; and uſing ſuch confidence and vehemence in his words; and ſometimes thundring alſo ſo terribly in my ears the danger wherein my Soul was: I muſt confeſs ſuch was my weakneſs, that I trembled a little though I knew no cauſe; and was afraid that I had been miſ-lead out of the company of ſo many Believers as he told me of. This hath been a double trouble to me; ſometimes to think that I ſhould be afraid without reaſon; and ſometimes ſuſpecting that there may be reaſon in what he ſaith, and my eyes ſo blinded that I cannot ſee it. Now I have opened my heart to you very freely; and I pray be not angry that I ſhould doubt either of your fidelity, or of your ability in the inſtructions you long ſince gave me.</p>
               <p>There is no cauſe for this Petition, ſaid the Good Father, I am willing you ſhould hear what every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaith, for then you will ſee the difference. It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a great deal that you ſhould doubt; than that you ſhould blindly reſign up your ſelf to all my dictates. I am none of thoſe that love to be believed becauſe I ſay it; nor that raiſe the ſound of my voice, to gain an advantage of them, whoſe modeſty will not let them be ſo loud. I will leave that priviledge to ſuch men as are in need of it, having nothing elſe to ſerve them; to ſome of whom I doubt your acquaintance is made a Proſelyte.<note place="margin">Lord <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con.</hi>

                  <hi>For there are a company of men in the World (as hath been noted long ſince by a Wiſe man)
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:101895:257"/>who love the ſalutation of</hi> Rabbi, <hi>or</hi> Maſter; <hi>and that not in Ceremony or Complement, but in an inward Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which they ſeek over mens minds; in drawing them to depend upon their Opinions; and to look for knowledge only at their lips. It is not the</hi> Lord Biſhops <hi>(as he ſpeaks) but theſe men, that are the Succeſſors of</hi> Diotrephes; <hi>the great Lovers of preheminence. They will be Lords over mens Faith; and overawe them into a belief of all that they preach. None may diſſent from their aſſertions; unleſs he be content to bear the brand of an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliever. It is all one to forſake the Goſpel, and to forſake their Opinions. You leave Chriſt if you leave them; and the Faith which was once delivered to the Saints is ſolely in their keeping. That which makes them the more uſurp upon others, is, that they have the hap to light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch natures who readily receive that which is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſpoken; and ſtifly maintain that which once they have embraced. Such are men of younger years, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial underſtandings; that are carried away with partial reſpect of perſons, or with the enticing appearance of godly names and pretences.</hi> There being few <hi>(as he obſerves)</hi> who follow the things themſelves, more than the names of the things, and moſt the names of the Maſters. <hi>Nay, moſt do ſide themſelves with theſe Maſters before they know their right hand from their left. And they skip from meer Ignorance, to a violent Prejudice: from knowing nothing to an Opinion that they know all things: or at leaſt to a confidence that they are not miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in what they know. This ſtrong prejudice is rarely overcome: for the honourable names of Sincerity, ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, godlineſs, and the glory of free grace being put in the front, and marching before their Doctrines; they can never be touched by thoſe that have a mind to aſſault them, but thoſe</hi> Holy things <hi>will firſt be thought to ſuffer a
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:101895:257"/>Violation.</hi> But as I intend to have nothing to do with theſe <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Maſters;</hi> ſo I would have you to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw your ſelf from the thraldom of their ſubjects. I may well be allowed to bid you not to follow them; ſeeing I would not have you follow me without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Exempt your ſelf from the number of thoſe that are ſheepiſhly led whither confident men will have them; or that are hurried away with the blaſts of a furious Zeal; or that are wont to tell voices, and not to weigh them. If there be any thing that I am to accuſe you of in this particular, it is only that which you have confeſſed; that you dare not (as I alſo noted heretofore) truſt your own reaſon; and adhere to the clear and well-poized reſolutions of your own mind, if any body raiſe a clamour againſt them. There is a certain Modeſty in your Soul which is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; if it do not betray you into the hands of thoſe that are ſo impudent as to out-face you. It will do you ſervice if it only reſtrain you from their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorineſs; (which you have as much right to uſe as themſelves if it were fit and decent) but it ought not to make you yield to them, becauſe they are ſo confident as to preſs for your conſent with great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, and without any reaſon. Time I hope will both embolden your Modeſty, and alſo ſettle your Notions better: making you to ſee that they excel the vain janglings, and the loud noiſes of the World, as much as light excelleth darkneſs. And to give you your due, you did well conceive and remember what I formerly ſaid, which I do not now recant. Still I tell you that <hi>he is a Believer unto Salvation, who being perſwaded of the truth of all that is ſaid of our Saviour, and all that he hath ſaid in the Goſpel, abandons all other intereſts, and ſtudies only to be obedient to him in all
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:101895:258"/>things.</hi> Let them ſay what they will of <hi>Recumbency</hi> and <hi>Reliance</hi> upon him, I think this man <hi>relyes</hi> upon him, and truſts him more than any body elſe; who upon the meer credit of his word is willing to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh all that he poſſeſſes, for that which Chriſt hath promiſed; to leave all that he ſees and feels, for that which is inviſible. This let us maintain to be the moſt ſoveraign degree of Faith; which will lift us up as high as Heaven, when the idle and lazy reliance of bold pretenders will let them ſink into the deepeſt place in Hell.</p>

               <head type="sub">A Diſcourſe with an Acquaintance of the Pilgrims about reſting on Chriſt for Salvation. The wilfulneſs, and unskilfulneſs of ſome Guides in the way to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> For what end <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed: and ſo what it is that our <hi>Faith</hi> is principally to reſpect. That <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a means to our end: and therefore <hi>Faith</hi> muſt go further than his perſon.</head>
               <p>AS they were talking thus together, that very man who was the occaſion of their diſcourſe chanced to paſs that way; and being of the <hi>Pilgrims</hi> acquaintance, joyned himſelf in company to them. Who perceiving what the argument of their preſent debate was, and being of a violent nature; began with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eagerneſs than ever to aſſert his own prejudices, and was plainly impatient of any contradiction. He raiſed up his voice to a ſtrange height, and told them both in flat terms that they adhered too much to their own righteouſneſs; that they muſt deny it quite, and
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:101895:258"/>reſt wholly upon Chriſt and his Merits; believing in him for pardon and Juſtification. And indeed his tongue ran at ſuch a rate that the Father could not get leave to thruſt in a word, till he had wearied himſelf with his own talk. And then he gravely aſkt him, Have you done Sir? Yes, replyed he. Then, proceeded the Father, let me intreat you to remember the old counſel; Soft and fair. You run a little too faſt, to make any good ſpeed. And as you make too much haſte in your diſcourſe, ſo you do alſo in your confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reſting upon Chriſt. I grant you that we muſt not depend upon our own righteouſneſs. But what danger is there of that when men have none at all? Let them ſtay till they be righteous, and then let them deny it all as much as they can. But to what purpoſe is it to tell them this before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come good, unleſs it be to keep them from ever being ſo? To what end doth it ſerve to urge the wickedeſt man in the World to caſt away that which he hath not? Whither doth it tend to bid them throw about them Anothers righteouſneſs to make them perfectly righteous, when they are indued with none of their own; but only to make them never ſeek for any elſe ſave that which is caſt over them? The ſame I ſay concerning your reſting upon Chriſt for Salvation. Is there a man that underſtands himſelf, who will truſt to any thing elſe but the Merits, Mercy, and Power of Jeſus, who is raiſed from the dead and is able to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us from the wrath to come? But how comes it about that all men get hither ſo very ſoon? Why muſt this be mentioned as the firſt thing that Faith hath to do, and as the only act that will juſtifie a ſinner? What is the reaſon of this Forwardneſs, that when men aſk What ſhall we do to be ſaved, you anſwer preſently;
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:101895:259"/>Caſt your ſelf upon the Merits of Chriſt? For this is your interpretation of the word, <hi>Believe,</hi> by which the Apoſtle reſolves that important Queſtion. Of what uſe is this early confidence, but only to make men prove Hypocrites; and to ſlight the commands of Chriſt; without obſerving of which they may on this faſhion be juſtified? I beſeech you conſider it well; and let me know by what art it is that men come to climb to the top-bough, without ever touching thoſe that are beneath? Let it be granted if you pleaſe that Faith in the Mercy of God is that to which our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion tends; that it is as it were the very uppermoſt Branch of the Tree. But doth not the tree put forth many under-branches, and muſt we not aſcend by theſe to the higheſt? There are other acts of Faith then, that muſt lead the way, and whereby we go up to that lofty Confidence; or elſe it is meer witchcraft which ſets us on ſo high a perch. Suppoſe we ſay that we are juſtified only by this Truſt in the infinite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning mercy of a loving Father through his Sons blood. Let this, if you will have it ſo, be thought the only act that Juſtifies. Yet, Doth not every body ſee that no man can reaſonably take the boldneſs to look for this pardoning mercy, unleſs he be made a new man and ſincerley obey the will of God? Muſt not his Faith (for there is nothing elſe to do it) firſt produce ſuch an intire and uniform holineſs of heart and life as Chriſt requires, before he be ſo confident? No doubt of it, or elſe it is meerly Preſumption. It is impoſſible that a mans relyance ſhould be ſtronger, with any reaſon; then the reſt of the acts of his faith are. And therefore ſhould we not ſpeak of Faith in ſuch words as will take in all that it hath to do: both that which reſpects our duty, as well as that which
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:101895:259"/>reſpects our benefit? Take heed I beſeech you again of a double miſchief which is very viſible; one to others and the ſecond to your ſelf. <hi>Firſt,</hi> beware how you ſpeak of Faith ſo looſely to your neighbours; in ſuch terms as they may eaſily abuſe. Do not ſay that juſtifying Faith is meerly a relyance on Chriſt for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. For though you mean well and live better; yet the wicked of the world never underſtand this aright: which is the cauſe (if you would know all) that makes me ſo zealouſly oppoſe you in this matter. They all lay hold on him, and his righteouſneſs to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the filthineſs wherein they live. Though you tell them that they ought to love him who hath dyed to procure righteouſneſs for them, yet they love their ſins better; and hope that he will love them never the worſe for it. It is impoſſible to perſwade an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, a Drunkard, or any ſuch perſon (great numbers of which to my knowledge comfort themſelves in their relyance on Chriſt) to become better; unleſs you give a better notion of Faith then this. And then for your ſelf I muſt warn you to take great heed that one piece of your Faith do not outgrow another. Do not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to ſhoot more upward then it doth downward; and to grow in tallneſs more then in thickneſs and ſtrength. I mean, let it not lift up it ſelf to heaven in aſſurance of Gods love, but proportionably to its root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in love and obedience to him. Let it not perk up in perſwaſions of Gods mercy, but as it increaſes in ſtrength and power to do him ſervice. It is a ſlender tree you know, very weak and eaſily broken; which ſprings up ſo much in length, but carries no body and hath not a thickneſs anſwerable to its heigth. Such is the Faith that mounts up in confidence without an anſwerable ſpreading and enlarging it ſelf in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:101895:260"/>of all Gods commands; and bringing forth all the fruits of a lively Faith. Nay it is the very way to deſpair, to be thus forward. For as thoſe tall and ſlender Trees by ſome ſtrong blaſts are apt to hang down their heads and touch the ground from whence they come. So do theſe high confidences in a time of trial and when men come to ſee how ungrounded they were: they are ready to end in as low a deſpair and great diſtruſt of all Gods mercy. Upon every occaſion you ſhall ſee ſuch people caſt into horrid fits if they be at all obſervant of their duty; which they think is ſome deſertion by God, but indeed. proceeds from the too great forwardneſs of their Faith; which did riſe too high and had not ſtrength enough to bear it up. Nay, if they began in this confidence, and their Faith pitched thus high at the very firſt; they ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of Gods favour till their Faith hath purified their hearts. They muſt come down again from the top of the tree, and begin at the bottom, in obedience to all God's Command.</p>
               <p>Theſe things with many others ſeemed ſo perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the man, who had a great deal of honeſty in him, that his confidence was ſtrangely abated. And the Father making a little pauſe; he altered the tone of his voice and modeſtly ſaid, I muſt ingenuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that I have been too raſh in oppoſing and cenſuring of you. I am not one of thoſe that will reſiſt clear convictions and conteſt meerly that they may not ſeem to be overcome; but I acknowledge ſincerely that I had too rude and confuſed notions of things; which precipitated me into this confidence of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputing with you. Be not troubled at it, replyed the Father, but rather think your ſelf happy that you
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:101895:260"/>underſtand more then you did; and that you have not loſt but found Truth in the midſt of a diſpute. And ſince you are ſo humble as to confeſs ſome of your faults; I preſume you will be thankful if you are told the reſt. Remember it then, that it is very miſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming to ſpeak loud; to accompany your diſcourſe with too much action; and to affirm any thing with too great a confidence and peremptorineſs. But know withall that I eaſily pardon them and paſs them by; becauſe they are not ſo much your own as the faults of your Teachers from whom you learnt them, and many more beſides. Theſe are the leaſt things that many of them are to be accuſed of; for there is a certain wilfulneſs (as it ſeems to me) that poſſeſſes their hearts; which will not let them exchange their unſafe &amp; imperfect definitions of Faith, for thoſe which are ſounder and more compleat. They are loath to acknowledge that they can err, or ſpeak unproperly. They had rather defend that which is badly done or ſaid, than ſtudy to make it better. And as men do in diſorders of government, they abuſe their wit, and ſtudy for reaſons why it ſhould be amiſs; rather then how it ſhould be amended. They will learn from none unleſs it be themſelves. They will reject the cleareſt light unleſs it ſhine out of their own minds. They would have Truth confined to a party; the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry phraſes of which if you do not accept, it is enough to beget a quarrel. Be not offended I beſeech you at this plainneſs, nor imagine that I intend to diminiſh your opinion of any men that are good; but only to give you Caution, that you do not think them to be better then are. You may conceive me indeed no competent Judge of other mens diſcourſes: will you hear therefore what a very Wiſe man thought a good

They can make men ſick of their ſins; but are not provided of efficacious remedies to purge them out. They let them ſee their ſores; but then they are palliated and ſeldome thoroughly healed. They know better how to bring Souls to that Queſtion,</hi> Men and Brethren what ſhall we do? <hi>than how to give a good anſwer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the doubt which they have raiſed. They make men ſee they are very bad, but know not how to go about to make them good. They magnifie Faith, and make all the world ſound with the noiſe of it; but ſtill men are to ſeek what this great thing ſhould be. They awake men out of their ſleep, and make them look and gaze about them; but let them ſee nothing of that which they have to take in hand. They bid them indeed Believe, but it is very hard to know when they do. They have intangled Faith in Diſputes; when it ſhould have been imployed in good Works. They have obſcured a plain thing, in many laborious definitions of it. They have made it ſo ſubtill, and to conſiſt in ſo nice a point; that it is a difficult thing for any to ſee it. They handle matters of doubt weakly, and as before a people that will accept of any thing. In the Doctrine of Manners, there is little to be had, but Generality and Repetition. The bread of life they toſs up and down, but break it not. They ſay in the groſs, that men muſt live well, but they tell them not how
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:101895:261"/>to live. They bring not their Doctrines down to Caſes of Conſcience; that a man may be warranted in his perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Actions, whether they be lawfull or not. Nor take they care to teach men their lawful liberty, as well as their reſtraints. To keep them from ſuperſtitious Obſervances, as well as Prophane tranſgreſſions. Nay, I wiſh we could not ſay that it is the leaſt of ſome mens care, to promote a godly life. Faith is made a thing that is quite diſtinct from it. Good Works and Faith are commonly oppoſed in the Juſtification of a ſinner. The one is thought to exclude the other. And to be juſtified, it is ſaid to be neceſſary that a man do Nothing for it. The moſt that Chriſt can get is by way of Gratitude, which you know is ſmall or none in bad Natures. At the beſt they will put him off with deſires, or purpoſes, or an indeavour of a new life; though ſtill theſe things be ineffectual.</hi> All which is ſaid for no other end, but that you may not have mens perſons in admiration. That you may be at liberty to prove all things, and hold faſt that which is good. That you may not bear a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reverence to Maſters then you do to Truth: which is ready to become the portion of thoſe who are more in love with it, then with their party. And ſince you ſeem to me to be one of thoſe, I ſhall ſpare no pains to bring you and Truth together. But if you think it needful I will give you further ſatisfaction in this which we have conteſted; and make you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that there is nothing plainer then that which I have ſaid of Faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>You will gratifie me very much, replyed the other, if you will be at the trouble to teach me this leſſon better. And I am prepared already by what I have now learnt, to conſider and weigh not <hi>who,</hi> but <hi>what</hi>
                  <pb n="506" facs="tcp:101895:262"/>it is that I hear. Very good, ſaid he again, let me Catechiſe you then a little, and be not offended at this common and eaſie Queſtion? Do you not think that Chriſt came into the World for ſome end? Nay, was he not ſent of God upon ſome high deſign? You cannot doubt of it, and therefore I will not ſtay for your anſwer. But tell me, what do you think that great end was? Wherefore, for inſtance, did he dye and ſhed his blood? Was it only that our ſins might be pardoned? Did he bear the Croſs, that we might bear none? Did he deny his own Will, that we might have liberty to do ours? Is his Death to excuſe us from holy living? <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> indeed thinks ſo: but true Religion teaches us that the intent of his death was, by keeping us from dying, to make us alive to God: By ſaving us from execution when we were condemned, to render us honeſt men: by denying of himſelf, to teach us to take up our Croſs and follow him. Will you hear what they that knew the mind of Chriſt have taught us in this argument. <hi>He that committeth ſin</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>John</hi>) <hi>is of the Devil,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Joh. 3.8.</note> 
                  <hi>for the Devil ſinneth from the beginning: For this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil:</hi> which is as much as to ſay that he appeared in the world that men might ceaſe to ſin. And ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.15.</note> 
                  <hi>That he dyed for all that they which live ſhould not henceforth live to themſelves but to him which dyed for them and roſe again: i.e.</hi> will come to judge them as a little before he had declared. This is the end for which he gave himſelf for his Church, <hi>That he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water by the word,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.25, 26, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>that he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh.</hi> Nor
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:101895:262"/>is it a ſlight and ſuperficial Holineſs that he intends; the clenſing only of the outſide, or the waſhing away of ſome pollutions; but <hi>He gave himſelf for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Titus 2.14.</note> 
                  <hi>and purify to himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi> For, <hi>he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled us</hi> (as it is in another place) <hi>in the body of his fleſh through death,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Colloſſ 1.21, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>to preſent us holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his ſight.</hi> And to ſay no more St. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo teaches us, that <hi>He his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own body on the tree,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.24.</note> 
                  <hi>that we being dead to ſin, ſhould live unto righteouſneſs: by whoſe ſtripes we are healed.</hi> I know not what ſenſe <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> may pick out of theſe words, which hopes the ſcourges on Chriſts back will ſave ſinners from the laſh; and that his death ſhall preſerve them from dying, though their ſins ſtill live: But it is evident to them that are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere that the Apoſtles meaning is; our Saviour dyed not meerly to ſave us from dying of our wounds, or to take away the anguiſh and torment of them; but that our Natures might be healed, and made ſound and whole again. He is ſuch a Phyſitian as removes the pain and the ſmart by curing of the wound; that eaſeth the part affected by making it well; that doth not lend his Creeple patient a Crutch to ſupport him, but infuſes ſtrength into his feet and anckle-bones, and ſpirits into his ſinnews that he may walk in the wayes of Gods commandments. I wiſh there was nothing harder then this to underſtand in the Book of God. It is not a truth which men cannot but which they will not underſtand. It is againſt a corrupt intereſt or elſe they would not reſiſt it. There is a ſtrong party in their heart againſt this end of Chriſts death, or elſe there would be no diſpute about it. The biaſs that inclines their will is not on the ſide of this truth.
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:101895:263"/>It contradicts their pleaſures, their unlawful gain, or ſome ſuch thing which they are loath to leave, and therefore it ſhall be falſe though never ſo clear in it ſelf, leſt theſe beloved ſins ſhould ſuffer any harm. But if there were any honeſty in mens hearts, if they were void of guile, they would be able to ſee this without the help of ſo many teſtimonies out of holy writ; that it was not a thing worthy of the Son of God to come and dye for any leſs end then to make the World better and render it obedient to the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. For what do you mean I beſeech you when you ſay that Jeſus ſatisfied for your ſins? What was it do you think that he gave ſatisfaction unto? Was it not all thoſe Glorious Attributes of God; his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, his Truth, his Juſtice, his Holineſs; ſaving the Honour of which, he might now paſs by the offences of returning ſinners? Was it not that the credit of all theſe might be maintained, and yet the rebels not periſh? That the Sentence might not be executed and yet the Authority of the Laws be preſerved? There is nothing plainer then that this death of Chriſt did do great honour to God in the face of the World; aſſerted his right; gave countenance to his Authority; proclaimed his righteouſneſs and purity; was a not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble teſtimony on his behalf againſt ſinners; and ſo there could be nothing more powerful to move God to grant a pardon to thoſe rebels that would ſubmit to him, ſince now he ſhould loſe nothing by it, but that which he had a mind to give away, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, <hi>viz.</hi> the penalties which they had incurred by the breach of his Laws. But is it not manifeſt then that God cannot love ſin, nor be friends with ſinners until they amend? Did not the death of Chriſt ſhew that his nature is ſuch that he cannot indulge men in
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:101895:263"/>their treſpaſſes? Is it not apparent that it was not fit to pardon even penitent and returning offenders, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he ſhewed his diſpleaſure at their offences? Did he not take care to ſecure his Authority when he iſſued out a pardon? There is nothing more viſible. And if Hypocriſie had not over-run us, and thruſt true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as well as Religion out of doors, men would eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee that Chriſt could not dye meerly to procure us a pardon; much leſs that men might ſin with more ſecurity, and without any fear of puniſhment. No, natural reaſon tells us, that men muſt needs be hateful to God while they are unlike him; that all the Blood of Chriſt cannot waſh them and make them lovely, as long as they continue in actual rebellion againſt him. His very nature is againſt ſuch men; his Wiſdom is an enemy to them. For how ſhould he maintain any Government in the World if he himſelf ſhould be the cheriſher of Traitors? if he ſhould take care for their protection, and ſet up a Sanctuary to which they may boldly fly; if he ſhould make the Altar of the Croſs a refuge where they may find Salvation and Safety, who are the oppoſers of his Authority? It cannot be that God ſhould be ſo liberal as to give away all his own right. He cannot quit his title and claim unto our univerſal obedience. It is impoſſible that Chriſt by his death ſhould repeal all the Laws of God, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve us from our duty. There is no queſtion he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſtrengthen them, when he made a relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And when he procured a diſpenſation, he did more eſtabliſh and ſecure that which is not diſpenſed withall. It is a rule of Reaſon, <hi>that all exceptions do confirm the Law.</hi> They tell us that it is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to any further indulgence. And therefore Chriſt dying that the puniſhment might not be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted;
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:101895:264"/>this is all the remiſſion that we are to expect, and not that God ſhould remit all our duty to him.</p>
               <p>It is very eaſie if men were well diſpoſed, to read at once in the death of Chriſt, the greateſt Love of God to us; and the greateſt Love to his Laws. His Love to us appears in that he would for our good, and that we might not be eternally undone, lay aſide his own right which he hath to puniſh: forgive us a debt which we were not able to pay: alter his Law, and abate the ſtrictneſs of it; diſpenſe with the execution of the Old Law, and make a New one of Grace and Favour: and that he might do ſo, and ſave both us from dying, and his Law from contempt by our eſcape; that he would provide ſuch a wiſe remedy as this of his Sons dying for us. Herein was his Love indeed manifeſted, and we can never ſufficiently admire it, that he would have him dye rather than us; that he would have him ſuffer that we might be delivered. But then this alſo plainly tells us the great Love that he bears to Holineſs, to his Laws, and to our Duty; which he took care ſhould not be injured by this favour and remiſſion. Though he would not have all dye out of love to us; yet he would have one, leſt we ſhould ſtill continue in the love of ſin. Though he would not have every one of us ſuffer for the breach of his Laws; yet he would have Chriſt ſuffer, that we might not take the boldneſs ſtill to break them. This death of his Son reduced things to an excellent temper; providing that neither we nor God might be damnified. That we might not ſuffer for what we have done, and that he might not ſuffer by our doing ſtill the ſame. That he might be what he is, and we become what we ought. That the old Original Laws which require
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:101895:264"/>our obedience might remain in force, and the rigour of them not be executed for our diſobedience. That he might part with ſome of his right, and yet reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the reſt. In one word, that he might be moved to let go his right to puniſh us, and we not moved to be careleſs in yielding him the reſt of his right which he hath to our hearty and conſtant obedience.</p>
               <p>I wiſh heartily that you and every body elſe would ſeriouſly conſider this, and not expect that God ſhould not require your ſervice, and obedience: for it is ſo much his due, that for the ſake of his Son, he cannot part with his right and claim unto it. Nay, I have a bolder thing to ſay than all this, and that is: That the Death of Chriſt is ſo far from intending our pardon only, that it is not the chiefeſt thing that he intends. Of the two, the purifying of our hearts and lives was more in his deſign than the forgiveneſs of ſin, and this was but in order to the other. So much you may eaſily gather from many of thoſe places of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writings which were mentioned before; for though he <hi>bare our ſins in his own body on the Tree,</hi> yet it was for this end, this was the ultimate ſcope of it, <hi>that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead to ſin, might live unto righteouſneſs.</hi> And ſo another Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He gave himſelf for our ſins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 1.4.</note> 
                  <hi>that he might deliver us from this preſent evil World.</hi> By ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his willingneſs to paſs by our faults, he would move us to acknowledge them, to repent of them, and become more dutiful. This muſt be done before we can actually receive his pardon and abſolution;<note place="margin">Titus 3.5, 6, 7.</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Apoſtle; <hi>He ſaved us according to his mercy by the waſhing of regeneration, and the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Ghoſt; that being juſtified by his Grace we ſhould be made Heirs of eternal life.</hi> Where it is viſible
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:101895:265"/>to them that will not ſhut their eyes, that his Mercy cannot ſave us unleſs we become New Creatures, and that this muſt go before the Juſtification which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect by the Grace of God: And indeed reaſon tells us that Chriſt muſt need have more regard to his Fathers rights than to our accommodation: and intend more the reclaiming of his rebellious ſubjects, than the procuring of their pardon.</p>
               <p>Which is a thing ſo apparent, that I am aſhamed to do more than mention it. And beſides by this time I believe you will be ready to aſk me a queſtion who have aſked you ſo many, and demand to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe have you made this long diſcourſe? The Anſwer is ready, and the end of it is as clear as any thing that hath been ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſince juſtifying Faith is to have reſpect to our Saviour and his Death juſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the intention of God in ſending of him; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo little as the caſting our ſelves upon him for pardon of ſin. The former part of this argument you will grant me; for we muſt look upon an object ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is propoſed. Faith cannot apprehend things otherwayes than God hath revealed them: it cannot receive the Son of God in any other manner than as the Father gave him. The conſequent then, God himſelf demands your aſſent unto; for you ſee that he had another end, and a far greater alſo in give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Son for us, than the forgiveneſs of our offences. He gave him, that he might cleanſe and purge our Souls from all filthineſs; that he might make us holy and unblameable in his ſight? Why do you not then thus receive him? Or how comes it about that you will not only put this end behind the other, but alſo ſpeak as if juſtifying Faith had nothing elſe to do, but to lay
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:101895:265"/>hold on the merits of Chriſt? This I am ſure you make to comprehend the whole notion of it, for we hear of nothing beſides in its definition. This is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the buſineſs of Faith, or elſe you do very ill not to expreſs the reſt. I beſeech you in the Name of Chriſt that dyed for us, reform this grand errour. Let your Faith be as large as the Goſpel it ſelf. And let this be your principal care, that it may <hi>purifie your heart.</hi> When you expect to be juſtified through Faith in his Blood;<note place="margin">Heb 9.14.</note> remember that it was ſhed to <hi>purge your conſcience from dead works to ſerve the Living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that I may reſume the beginning of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and ſo make way for a ſpeedy concluſion, let me aſk you another Queſtion or two, which ſeem to be very pertinent to my preſent deſign. If there was an end, and ſo great an one as you have confeſſed of Chriſts coming into the World, then what is he but a means unto this end? <hi>He dyed,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.18.</note> 
                  <hi>that he might bring us to God.</hi> And <hi>by him we believe in God</hi> who raiſed him from the dead, and gave him Glory <hi>that our Faith and Hope might be in God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 1.21.</note> Our belief in God then (which is no ſmall thing, but comprehends all our duty to him) was the end of Chriſts Appearing, and of all he did: and therefore muſt not he ſtand in the place of a means to it? It muſt be ſo, ſaid the other. But what then, continued the Father, will become of your <hi>reſting on Chriſt,</hi> and your ſtaying or leaning on him for Salvation? Is it not manifeſt that this only is inſufficient for your purpoſe? that it will let you fall to the ground, and leave you ſhort of your happineſs? Is it not plain that this Faith fixes it ſelf where it ſhould proceed; and reſts in the means whereby it ſhould advance to a noble end? There is
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:101895:266"/>nothing me-thinks more evident than that the Faith which juſtifies a ſinner is not that which laſtly termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates it ſelf in the perſon of Chriſt; and which doth not clearly and in its own nature produce a cordial obedience to God. Means muſt be uſed and not reſted in. From whence it unavoidably follows that Chriſt himſelf and his merits muſt not be reſted in as the laſt end of our Faith; but it muſt go further and beget an holy life. Let us ſo ſpeak of Faith then, that it may be viſible whither it tends. Let it be ſeen at what it aimes; and that it deſigns more than the caſting our ſelves into the arms of Chriſt, that he may protect us from the wrath to come. Learn I beſeech you before it be too late, that Jeſus cannot ſave a man by a naked confidence in him, <hi>i.e.</hi> in his perſon, or any thing that he hath done, or can do. All they that think ſo, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach our Saviour, and make him the advocate of ſin, and not of ſinners; one that ſhall ſave their luſts, and not them from the power of them. They ſtay in the half-way to Heaven, and ſo ſhall never come thither. They reſt when they ſhould go forward. They lean upon that ſtaff wherewith they ſhould walk. They make Chriſt their ſupport only, who ſhould be alſo their ſtrength. They caſt themſelves upon him, but would not have him carry them to God and a divine nature. They make him to ſtand in their way, and not to be the way unto obedience. They render him an enemy to God, who ſhall keep his ſubjects with him, and detain them from their duty. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with what they find in him, and care not for any righteouſneſs of their own. They reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with what he hath done, and by vertue of that do nothing themſelves. And ſo he that is made of God a means of life, they make to themſelves a means
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:101895:266"/>of death: becauſe they make him indeed the End of all, and not the means to our End.</p>

               <head type="sub">The joy which the Pilgrim conceived in this diſcourſe: and how much he applauded his happineſs in having ſuch a Friend. The Serenity of his Condition after all theſe Clouds. And how nothing troubled him but only that he could do ſo little to teſtifie his love to his Guide: who eaſily gave him ſatisfaction by ſhewing the true grounds of Friendſhip.</head>
               <p>IT is not to be expreſſed what contentment the Man took in this diſcourſe, for which he rendred him a thouſand thanks: profeſſing that he had learnt a great deal in a little time; and that though he never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leſs than to become a Good man by Faith in Chriſt, yet he did not ſo well underſtand till now how to go about the buſineſs. But the Joy of our <hi>Pilgrim</hi> was far greater both for this acquaintance of his, and for himſelf. He thought that all his life would be little enough wherein to thank him; that he had turned the mention of his weakneſſes and frailties, into the occaſion of ſo great a benefit unto them both. I was going to tell you (ſaid he, when the Father had done) that I knew not whether I ſhould begin to thank our Lord or you firſt for this great kindneſs to me. But I think I need not ſtand in doubt, for you are ſo like him, that if I commend your Charity, and render you thanks for it; I do a real honour thereby to him. You have been the Eaſe of mine heart; the Guide of my mind; the Pilot of my ſoul; the ſecurity and ſtay of
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:101895:267"/>my life; my ſecond and better ſelf; my Tutelar An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel whereby I have been defended from innumerable dangers. And when I ſay ſo, I acknowledge God to have been all this, who by your hands hath imparted theſe favours to me. I know that I ſtand indebted to his Fatherly Goodneſs for ſo many Bleſſings that I know not where to end the account. But for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; I cannot but next to the favours his Son hath brought us, place the gift of your Friendſhip. You will ſuffer me now ſure to pleaſe my ſelf a little, and to glory in it; though heretofore you ſuppreſſed my thoughts as they were iſſuing forth. I know very well at what rate my neighbours eſteem riches, and how proud they grow if they can ſhew you Gold and Jewels. But if Heaven had aſked me what Jewel it pleaſed me to be preſented withall; I would have anſwered, Give me a Friend: Send me an honeſt Friend. This is my Riches, my Treaſures, my moſt precious Jewel. It is not poſſible there ſhould be any thing given me of equal value. I am ſo proud of it, that it tempts me to be vain-glorious, and to proclaim to the World how wealthy I am. And if we may judge of the price of things by their ſcarcity, am I not in the right? What is there more rare than this pure Friendſhip? Where ſhall we find two men that have one heart; and love without any intereſt? Muſt we not go back to the Golden Times, and have recourſe to the Age of Poetry, to find ſuch an happy pair? What place is not filled with that old complaint, <hi>O Friends, no body is a Friend?</hi> There are few hearts that are not double; few tongues that are not cloven. They that are not treacherous are too weak; and they that are not weak, yet are too wiſe, to be tyed in this Sacred Bond. How can you
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:101895:267"/>blame me then that I think my ſelf ſome-body now that I am poſſeſſed of ſo great a Treaſure; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides its rarity, is to be highly eſteemed for its ſtability and laſting nature. It is not ſubject to the change of fortune, nor the ruſt of time, nor the violence of men: nor can it be loſt by my own negligence, for a ſmall care will ſerve to keep a true friend. Let others go and beg of great Men their favour: let others glory in the preferment they already enjoy; I envy not their happineſs, may heaven but pleaſe to preſerve my Friend. It is the cuſtom of many I ſee to fetch the cauſes of their felicity or unhappineſs from the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bodies; and to aſcribe what they ſuffer or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy here below to ſome good or malignant influences from above. But as for me I do not think there is any Planet ſo lucky as a faithful friend; as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary none ſo malitious as a falſe-hearted companion. Let them who liſt then obſerve the ſtars and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable aſpects, I will ſeek upon earth for that which muſt make me happy. Let them obſerve how <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> look upon them in all their affairs; it imports moſt to me to mark what men I converſe withall. And you are the perſon Sir whom I ſix my eye upon and whoſe good aſpect and charitable influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence I ſtill implore. Do you accompany me alwayes in my travels; be you my <hi>Mercury</hi> in my journey; and in this conjunction I ſhall not fear any evil that may threaten me, nor deſpair any more of finiſhing that which is ſo happily begun. This is the ſum of my deſires that you would ever exerciſe your wonted pitty towards me and pardon my follies. For the whole ſtock of comfort that I am furniſhed withall can only ſerve for a meaner affliction then the loſs of your love would prove unto me. And yet I hope that
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:101895:268"/>I ſhall not be altogether ſo troubleſome to you in the reſt of my journey; but rather become your joy. It ſhall be my daily petition that I may ſpend my dayes in that evenneſs and ſteadineſs of mind wherein I find my ſelf fixed by your means. That I may be humble, and wait patiently upon the Lord, and be of good courage; believing that he will ſtrengthen mine heart, and that one day I ſhall in <hi>Sion</hi> appear before God.</p>
               <p>To which good prayer the Father inſtantly ſaid, <hi>Amen,</hi> wiſhing that he might ever find him in this good temper, and that he would likewiſe remember the counſel of the Apoſtle who bids us <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord alwayes.</hi> For there is not a more evident token and apparent ſign of true Wiſdom and profiting in Vertue, then a conſtant ſerenity and unconſtrained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing. And truly, ſaid he, I think I need not do ſo little as deſire this for you, but may be bold to turn my wiſh into a confidence; for I am apt to propheſie that after ſo many conflicts you will go in more peace to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And ſo it proved as I have ſince heard, and after this he every day had a view of that bleſſed place. The ſky indeed was ſometimes a little cloudy, which rendred the ſight of it more duſkiſh and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure; yet he kept a calm in his mind in his greateſt dulneſs, and hoped for Sun-ſhine dayes; which came a great deal ſooner, by not raiſing a new and thicker cloud, through the ſtorms of his own paſſions. But I cannot ſay for the preſent what the enſuing part of their travels were, my own obſervation here having an end. Only thus much I obſerved before I parted, that he who once was afraid that he loved his friend too much, fell into a ſuſpition of himſelf that he did
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:101895:268"/>not embrace him with ſuch an affection as he deſerved. And that after all theſe contrary humours, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of their friendſhip was ſo excellent, of ſuch conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency and ſo well ſetled; that as nothing could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order it, ſo nothing but death alone could divide it; and death it ſelf they were confident could never put an end to it. And indeed this was the thing that I left them in expectation of, and which they were conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indeavouring to prepare themſelves for; as that which would not deſtroy, but perfect their love. This they often talkt of; knowing that it would never come the ſooner for their thinking and ſpeaking of it. This they lookt upon as a common friend to both; that would tranſlate them to thoſe happy regions where friendſhip is in its Kingdom and raigns over every heart. All the favour they would have beg'd, if it were wont to grant any petitions; was, that with one ſtroke it would arreſt them both and carry them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together. And if any body could have made good the <hi>Paracelſian</hi> promiſe of ſpinning out the life of man to a length equal with the clue of time, and making our vital oil of the ſame durable temper with that which feeds the Lamps of Heaven; All things were ſo in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon between them, that I verily think one of them would not have accepted of ſuch a courteſie, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to injoy it alone without the other. No, they rather deſired as I ſaid that the one might not ſee the other expire; but that the ſame hand might cut off both their threds at once, and that one moment might put out thoſe Lamps which were not willing to burn aſunder.</p>
               <p>All the wiſhes that our <hi>Pilgrim</hi> made beſides this, was only that they might live ſo long, till he could
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:101895:269"/>give ſome remarkable proof of his affection to his Guide. For though he knew that he loved him above all things, and could contradict even his former wiſhes by dying for him; yet it did ſometimes a little diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him that he was in no capacity to ſhow his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs but only by words and proteſtations. Though the wiſdom of his Conductor had ſtood him in ſo great ſtead, and he could not well ſpare any of it; yet he was ſo fooliſh now and then as to think that if he had been leſs wiſe he himſelf had been more happy: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then he might have ſtood in need to receive thoſe counſels, which now he only gave; and been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited for thoſe courteſies, which now he made him a pure debtor for. Many other benefits alſo that are uſually communicated between friends he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf utterly deſtitute of all means to confer; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either not in his power, or his Guide in no need of them. This ſometimes raiſed a ſmall diſquiet in his mind; and one day I remember he could not contain himſelf, but he began a diſcourſe to this purpoſe, which ſhall put an end to this preſent Relation.</p>
               <p>I ſhould think my ſelf, ſaid he, the happieſt man alive was I but able to correſpond with you in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and offices of friendſhip; and were I not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to return you only a weak and fruitleſs paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for that efficacious love which hath done me ſo many ſervices. It troubles me a little to find that my paſſion is as uſeleſs as it is extream: and as void of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to you as it is violent in it ſelf. It is no leſs bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren then I doubt it may be burdenſome; and hath as little profit as I ſee it hath brought you much trouble. Though the honour be very great you have done me in beſtowing ſuch a place upon me in your heart; yet
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:101895:269"/>I know not ſometimes whether I ſhould not complain in the enjoyment of a favour, which as it was not in my hands to deſerve, ſo I cannot poſſibly requite. True indeed it is that I have given my ſelf to you; but that is no more than ſtrict Juſtice exacts, ſince I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived your ſelf as a gift to me. Friendſhip they ſay is a commutation of hearts; and therefore it is but fit that you ſhould have mine in room of your own. And yet alas! mine is of ſuch ſmall value, that I doubt you will be wholly a loſer by the change. Is there no means for me to do you ſervice, or to reſt content with a will to ſerve you? Cannot you either ſhew <hi>me</hi> how I may be uſeful to you; or ſhew <hi>your ſelf</hi> a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to it in that heart which I have given you? I ſhould be ſatisfied I think if you knew my will as well as my ſelf. It remains in your power, not my own, to ſettle my mind in peace; if you will firſt believe I love you, and then ſet a value upon that Love, which you know is the cauſe of all well-doing; and ought not to be blamed for want of power.</p>
               <p>Very true, ſaid his Guide, who laid hold of that word, I think that I have found a treaſure in your Love; and I will have it paſs for currant payment, though it cannot expreſs it ſelf in ſuch ſenſible effects as you would have it. It is enough to me that you have ſuch a paſſionate affection for me; though it could never find the means to do any thing, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell me how hearty it is. I am pleaſed with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and deſires which you have to do me any good. It is an extraordinary contentment to me to contemplate the imaginations which are in your mind of what you would do for me; could power be cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by your will to come and joyn it ſelf unto it. They
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:101895:270"/>are the Vulgar who call nothing benefits, but what they can feel with their fingers. It is the portion of groſs Souls to be inſenſible; unleſs your courteſies, to come at their hearts, paſs through their hands. The purer and more refined Spirits touch the very Souls of their Friends, and feel the kindneſs which lyes in their breaſts. They are ſo ſubtil as to ſee a courteſie while it is ſo young, as to be but only in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. They touch it before it be cloathed in matter, or have paſſed beyond the confines of thoughts. They meet it in the firſt rudiments, and embrace it while it is only in meaning and drawn in the imagination. They receive theſe inward acts of Love as moſt pure and ſpiritual; being ſeparate from all the terreſtrial part which affect the vulgar minds. And in one word there is not any thing dearer to them than thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Soul, which finding nothing they can do correſpondent to their own greatneſs and force; do terminate in themſelves. They are pleaſed to ſee them ſtay there and go no further; becauſe there is nothing fairer than themſelves to be met withall, wherein to end and reſt.</p>
               <p>Do not depretiate your affection therefore, nor vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie it in that manner you are wont; as though it were not worthy my acknowledgement. Do not tell me any more that it is no valuable Love which doth not ſerve our Friends: for this ſervice depends upon occaſions; and they depend on an higher Being, and are only in the diſpoſe of Providence. All that I can be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to you for, I have received already from you; and for the reſt, if it could be beſtowed, I muſt make my acknowledgements to ſomething elſe. Be contented then that you give all that is in your hands; and that
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:101895:270"/>if it were in them to make occaſions, you would ſtill let thoſe be wanting, which moſt of all prove a friend. Nay let me tell you, I am ſo favourable in my opinion to your affection, and ſo apt to give it the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; that I am not yet reſolved, but there may be as much nobleneſs in the handſome acknowledgement of a kindneſs, as there is in the conferring of that which deſerves ſuch acknowledgement. But beſides all this, let me aſk you a Queſtion (for I am reſolved to ferret this ſcruple out of the bottom of your heart) ſhould you not love me unleſs I had done you benefits? Tell me the truth; is there any great dearneſs think you created in peoples hearts towards each other by this means? For my part I have often found the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion true; that the remembrance of benefits wears out of mens minds, as grief doth out of the heart of afflicted perſons; from which every moment ſteals a part. Time hath power over the one as well as the other; and it diminiſhes the affection which is the fruit of favours, as it doth the ſorrow which is produced by loſſes and calamities. Nay, ſo little power have bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to make a friend, that they ſometimes make a foe. There are ſome men, the more they owe, the more they hate. A little debt makes a man a debtor, but a great one makes him an enemy. What is it then that produces a durable Friendſhip? Nothing ſure but worth and deſert; together with the agreeableneſs of a perſon to our humour, and his reſemblance to our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. The impreſſion which theſe make can never be blotted out. Time which wipes away the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of benefits, can never efface the ſenſe of worth and merit. We alwayes carry in our minds the amiable perfections, and accompliſhed qualities of worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. We alwayes think of thoſe who have touched
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:101895:271"/>our inclinations by their agreeable nature. And I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to you whether you could refuſe me your Love, though you were not ſo much beholden to me as you now acknowledge. And whether all the kindneſſes in the world would produce a Friendſhip with me, if you ſaw not ſomething elſe to woe your affection. No, no, my Friend, it is Gratitude, not Friendſhip which is the proper effect of benefits. They ought to diſpoſe us to ſuitable returns, and an hearty acknowledgement; but they cannot oblige us to entertain him for a Friend who is bountiful toward us. They may poſſibly make our Friendſhip grow, but they cannot beget it. They may give it ſome nouriſhment, but they cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and bring it forth. It depends upon an higher cauſe, it owes its Original to ſome nobler thing; to that from whence all benefits and good offices ought to come, I mean a great love and a ſincere affection; which if deſerts be not wanting, is more powerful to move than all the gifts in the world; and is able with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them all to tye us faſt to a worthy perſon. Be ſo juſt then to your ſelf and to me, as to think that I am your Friend; though you do not beſtow thoſe benefits on me which you deſire; ſince they can ſerve only (as I ſaid) to make me thankful, but not your Friend. I eſteem you very highly for your ſelf, and upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of your own proper worth, which I am ſure doth put me into the next diſpoſition to be your Friend. And ſince you have added to your own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, a very great Love to me; that cannot but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat it, and make me perfectly yours. This Love alone hath been thought ſufficient to make a Friend; and indeed is more powerful than any benefits. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of <hi>Hecaton;</hi> Wouldſt thou know how to get a Friend? I will ſhew thee, and thou ſhalt uſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:101895:271"/>Medicament, Herb, or Inchantment to produce the affection thou deſireſt. <hi>If thou wilt be beloved; Love.</hi> When Vertue then and it have made a league; and ſhews it ſelf in a ſubject whoſe qualities alſo are worthy to be embraced; its force muſt needs be ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible, and leave us no power to withſtand its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>
               <p>The poor <hi>Pilgrim</hi> remained aſtoniſhed a while at the kindneſs of this diſcourſe: And finding himſelf overwhelmed with the weight of ſuch Love, was fain to ſtrive very much to recover a power of making this ſhort reply unto it. I am utterly ignorant, ſaid he, what worth it is that you aſcribe to me, which hath brought me into your good eſteem, and obtained me the noble title of your Friend. I ſee that I pleaſe you, but I know not what it is that ſhould give you that pleaſure. I find my ſelf very happy; but what hath advanced me to this felicity I cannot define. And truly ſince it is your will to have me ſo, I will not be too buſie and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in examining the cauſes of my good fortune; nor will I ſeek to leſſen my worth, leſt in ſo doing I ſhould upbraid you with a bad foundation of your Love. No, I will rather think I am worth ſomething, than render your judgement nothing worth. I will think of my ſelf as you would have me, that you may not ſeem to be miſtaken. There is nothing elſe can make me of any value; unleſs it be that I had the wit to judge of the deſervings of ſuch a perſon as your ſelf. It is a mark they ſay of ſome ſufficiency to be able to diſcern an able perſon from a flaſhy wit. It is a note I have heard of great wiſdom to chuſe an excellent Friend. By this I am told a man is known to others, and I have little elſe whereby to know my ſelf. This is the chiefeſt
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:101895:272"/>thing that makes me ſee I am not ſo unfortunate as I thought. I perceive I am worthy of ſome eſteem, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had the judgement to ſet ſuch an eſteem upon your ſelf. For I muſt needs confeſs that though your favours could have impoſed a greater neceſſity upon me of loving than you will allow; yet I feel that I am not beholden to them for my <hi>Inclination</hi> to love you. That is ſomething more antient than any benefits you can beſtow; and depends only on your own merits. And let it not be judged an amplification to ſay, that they are ſo great, that they will not leave it to my choice either whether I will love you or no, or how much I will love you; but they conſtrain me to love you as much as I can. It is a conſtraint indeed to which I am very willing, there being no violence of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered but of what my own judgement is the cauſe: yet it is irreſiſtable; and I can never be of any other mind, nor have a will to diſpoſe of my affections other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes. Nay I cannot for my life but think that your favours are a part of your deſerts; and that there is ſomething peculiar in them to merit mine affection. They flow purely from your own goodneſs, and owe not themſelves ſo much as to my entreaties. You have not put me to the trouble of begging your kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, but they ran to me of their own accord. I did but aſk; and you were pleaſed to open your heart, and make me a liberal gift. I did but ſhew my need; and you inſtantly inriched me with your ſelf. And ever ſince I have not had ſo great a care to conceal my griefs, as you have taken to find them out. Nor have you ſuffered my troubles to ſpeak, before you ſaw them in my looks. All your favours likewiſe have flowed ſo freely from you, that there was no hope they ſhould return again. They have brought me a great
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:101895:272"/>deal of happineſs, but could not be thought to come to fetch any to him that ſent them. This adds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding much to the eſteem I have conceived for you. This will ever make me to propound you as the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of an excellent Friend. And if I were now to dye, it would be one of the laſt words I ſhould ſpeak to thoſe that love me. <hi>Remember that thoſe will be your worſt enemies; not to whom you have done evil, but who have done evil to you: and thoſe will be your beſt Friends; not to whom you have done good, but who have done good to you.</hi>
